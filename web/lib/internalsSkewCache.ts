/**
 * Staleness check for internals skew history cache.
 *
 * The UW risk-reversal skew API publishes end-of-day data after market close.
 * readLongRangeSkewHistory() previously blocked all fresh fetches when the
 * market was closed, causing stale data to persist across sessions.  This
 * helper lets the caller decide whether the disk cache is still fresh enough
 * to serve without hitting the FastAPI backend.
 */

/**
 * Returns `true` when the cached skew data is recent enough to serve
 * directly (no fresh fetch needed).
 *
 * "Fresh" means the latest data-point date is within `maxStaleDays`
 * calendar days of `todayET`.  The default of 1 day covers:
 *   - same-day cache → fresh
 *   - previous-day cache → fresh (handles overnight / pre-market)
 *   - 2+ days behind  → stale  (triggers a fresh fetch)
