## Recent Evaluations

### IBM — 2026-03-05 ⛔ NO_TRADE
- **Decision**: NO_TRADE
- **Failing Gate**: KELLY (Milestone 6) — Edge passed, Structure failed
- **📊 Data as of**: 2026-03-05 2:01 PM PT (LIVE — all milestones fetched fresh)
- **Edge PASSED**: 5 consecutive days of accumulation (Feb 27–Mar 5), today is STRONGEST day (83.1%)
  - Feb 27: 73.3% → Mar 02: 80.4% → Mar 03: 82.3% → Mar 04: 81.7% → **Mar 05: 83.1%** (building)
  - Aggregate 76.4%, strength 52.8 (threshold: 50 ✅)
  - Sustained 5 days (threshold: 3 ✅)
- **Options conflict is ARTIFICIAL**: 29.58x P/C ratio driven by deep ITM puts ($300/$305 strikes on $257 stock = synthetic/hedging). Actual flow alerts: $3.85M calls vs $2.39M puts = call-heavy. Recent bias BULLISH.
- **Why no trade — Kelly negative on ALL structures tested**:
  - $265/$285 spread: R:R 2.11:1 ✅, P(ITM)=0.48, conditional value=$10.50, EV=$5.04 < cost $6.43 → **Kelly -25%**
  - $270/$285 spread: R:R 3.18:1 ✅, P(ITM)=0.40, EV=$3.80 < cost $3.59 → **Kelly -22%**
  - $275/$290 OTM: R:R higher but P(ITM) too low → **Kelly -9%**
- **Root cause**: IBM is a low-vol stock (HV20 ~37%, IV rank 42). Options are fairly priced for the expected move. The 5-day DP edge adds ~5-8% to ITM probability, but that's insufficient to overcome the option premium. IBM doesn't produce convex payoffs at current IV levels.
- **Context**: Seasonality FAVORABLE (March 75% win rate). Analysts 60% Buy, $276 target (+7.5%). OI changes all MODERATE ($4.7M total, no massive signals).
- **Ticker Verified**: YES — IBM, Technology, $250/share
- **Lesson**: A genuine DP signal on a low-vol name can still fail Kelly. Edge ≠ trade. Convexity requires sufficient vol to create asymmetric payoffs.
- **Action**: WATCH only. Would need IBM IV to compress significantly (IVR < 20) or DP flow to intensify (90%+ buy ratio) before reconsidering.

### NFLX (Netflix) - 2026-03-05 ⛔ NO_TRADE
- **Decision**: NO_TRADE
- **Failing Gate**: EDGE (Milestone 4)
- **📊 Data as of**: 2026-03-05 12:32 PM PT (LIVE — all milestones fetched fresh)
- **Reason**: Accumulation cycle BROKE TODAY. Feb 27–Mar 4 showed 4-day sustained accumulation (84–93% buy). But **Mar 5 (TODAY): NEUTRAL (54.4%, strength 0.0)** — broke the streak.
  - Feb 26: DISTRIBUTION (37.5%)
  - Feb 27: ACCUMULATION (92.5%, 85.1 strength)
  - Mar 2: ACCUMULATION (92.7%, 85.4 strength)
  - Mar 3: ACCUMULATION (85.0%, 69.9 strength)
  - Mar 4: ACCUMULATION (84.4%, 68.9 strength)
  - **Mar 5 (TODAY): NEUTRAL (54.4%, 0.0 strength)** ← streak broken
  - Sustained consecutive days = **0** (need 3+)
  - Recent strength = 0.0 (need >70 for alternative criterion)
- **What passed**: Aggregate strength 65.4 (>50), $39M in OI changes (1 MASSIVE signal), chain data available, 82.7% aggregate buy ratio
- **What failed**: Today's neutral print resets sustained days to 0. Same pattern as AAPL — institutions accumulated Feb 27–Mar 4 then stopped.
- **GARCH context**: HV20 (57.9%) − LEAP IV (43.3%) = +14.5 pts → LEAP vega is cheap. But without sustained DP flow, no edge to trigger the trade.
- **Ticker Verified**: YES — Netflix, Communication Services, $98.45
- **Action**: Add to WATCH. Re-evaluate if sustained accumulation resumes (3+ consecutive days). Also monitor for standalone LEAP IV play if HV20−IV gap widens further.

### AAPL (Apple Inc.) - 2026-03-05 ⛔ NO_TRADE
- **Decision**: NO_TRADE
- **Failing Gate**: EDGE (Milestone 4)
- **📊 Data as of**: 2026-03-05 11:00 AM PT (LIVE — all milestones fetched fresh)
- **Reason**: Accumulation cycle FADED. Feb 27 monster print (99.3%, $3.17B) was genuine but has not sustained:
  - Mar 3: DISTRIBUTION (25.6%) — broke accumulation streak
  - Mar 4: Weak accumulation (74.2%, strength 48.4)
  - **Mar 5 (TODAY): NEUTRAL (55.2%, strength 10.5)** — signal fading
  - Sustained consecutive days = **0** (need 3+)
  - Recent strength = 10.5 (need >70 for alternative criterion)
- **What passed**: Aggregate strength 62.7 (>50), $11.8M MASSIVE OI at Apr $270C, chain LEAN_BULLISH (P/C 0.53x), seasonality FAVORABLE (65%), analysts 75.9% Buy
- **What failed**: No sustained direction from most recent day. Recent flow alerts turning BEARISH. Accumulation cycle appears completed — institutional buying peaked Feb 27 and is winding down.
- **Critical lesson**: Without today's DP data (Mar 5), this would have PASSED edge. Fetching fresh data prevented a trade against a fading signal.
- **Seasonality**: FAVORABLE (March 65% win rate, +3.8% avg)
- **Analyst Ratings**: 29 analysts, 75.9% Buy, $288 target (+9.6%)
- **Ticker Verified**: YES — Apple Inc., Technology, $3.85T market cap
- **Action**: Add to WATCH. Re-evaluate if sustained accumulation resumes (3+ consecutive days).

### GOOG - 2026-03-04 ✅ EXECUTED
- **Decision**: TRADE
- **Structure**: Bull Call Spread $315/$340 (44 contracts)
- **Fill**: $6.26 net debit ($27,544 total)
- **Gates**: All three passed (Convexity 3.0:1, Edge 89.7 strength, Risk 2.46%)
- **Thesis**: Extraordinary institutional accumulation confirmed by bullish options flow

### AMD - 2026-03-03 (LEAP IV Scan Follow-up)
- **Decision**: NO_TRADE
- **Failing Gate**: EDGE
- **Reason**: IV mispricing confirmed (HV20 85.9% vs LEAP IV ~60%, +27% gap). However, dark pool accumulation cycle appears COMPLETED — Feb 24 distribution → Feb 26-27 strong accumulation → Mar 2 reverted to neutral. Aggregate strength only 19.5 (need >50). Options flow LEAN_BEARISH (P/C 1.49x) with put buying. Price already rallied from ~$170 to ~$198 during accumulation window.
- **Seasonality**: NEUTRAL (March 50% win rate)
- **Ticker Verified**: YES
- **Note**: Existing AMD LEAP position already in portfolio (see trade #5). Current flow suggests edge has faded — monitor for position review.

### APO (Apollo Global Management) - 2026-03-05
- **Decision**: NO_TRADE
- **Failing Gate**: EDGE
- **Reason**: Dark pool aggregate strength 10.3 (need >50). 3 of 5 days NEUTRAL. 0 consecutive days sustained direction. Options flow is BEARISH (P/C 2.05x, $8.2M put premium, sweep activity on Jun $105 puts), but dark pool does NOT confirm distribution — flow is neutral, not selling. Without DP confirmation, put buying could be hedging, not directional. OI changes all MODERATE (<$1M per position, $3.08M total). No massive institutional positioning in either direction.
- **Seasonality**: UNFAVORABLE (March 29% win rate, -4.2% avg return)
- **Analyst Ratings**: Unavailable (rate limited)
- **Ticker Verified**: YES — Apollo Global Management, Financial Services, $63.5B market cap

### RMBS - 2026-03-03
- **Decision**: NO_TRADE
- **Failing Gate**: EDGE
- **Reason**: Alternating accumulation/distribution pattern. Aggregate strength 42.0 (need >50). Only 1 day of recent accumulation.
- **Seasonality**: FAVORABLE (March 65% win rate)
- **Ticker Verified**: YES

### TSLA - 2026-03-03
- **Decision**: NO_TRADE
- **Failing Gate**: EDGE
- **Reason**: Accumulation cycle appears completed. 3 days accumulation followed by neutral reversal. Aggregate strength only 20.2.
- **Seasonality**: UNFAVORABLE (March 47% win rate)
- **Ticker Verified**: YES

### MSFT - 2026-03-04 ✅ PENDING EXECUTION
- **Decision**: TRADE (pending user confirmation)
- **Structure**: Long LEAP Call $575 (Jan 2027)
- **Edge**: VERIFIED via OI change analysis
  - $95M institutional LEAP call purchase confirmed
  - $625 Call: +100,458 OI, $51M premium
  - $575 Call: +50,443 OI, $45M premium
  - $675 Call: +50,148 OI, $15M premium (short leg)
- **Flow Alerts**: Did NOT show this — discovered via OI change endpoint
- **Dark Pool**: 97-98% buy ratio Mar 2-3, strength 94-96
- **Technical**: 14-week RSI at lowest since 2008
- **Kelly**: 12.6% optimal → 2.5% allocation ($29,915)
- **R:R**: 5.7:1
- **Note**: This evaluation led to discovery of OI change methodology

### MSFT - 2026-02-28
- **Decision**: NO_TRADE
- **Failing Gate**: EDGE
- **Reason**: 4 days accumulation followed by massive Friday distribution (0.8% buy ratio). Pattern = completed round-trip.
- **Ticker Verified**: YES

## Infrastructure

### Startup Protocol
The Pi startup extension (`.pi/extensions/startup-protocol.ts`) automatically runs checks with **full visibility**:

**Output Format (two-phase notification):**
```
🚀 Startup: Running 4 checks...     <- IMMEDIATE on startup
```
Then when async tasks complete:
```
[1/4] ✓ Loaded: Spec, Plans, Runbook, Status, Context Engineering
[2/4] ✓ IB trades in sync
[3/4] ✓ Monitor daemon running
[4/4] ✓ No free trade opportunities
✅ Startup complete (4/4 passed)
```

**⚠️ Auto-Reconciliation Rule:**
When startup shows `⚠️ IB: N new trades`, **IMMEDIATELY**:
1. Read `data/reconciliation.json`
2. Log each trade to `data/trade_log.json`
3. Update `docs/status.md`
4. Clear reconciliation flag
5. Validate JSON

**Do NOT wait for user prompt — this is automatic.**

**Notification Strategy:**
- **Immediate**: Show check count as soon as Pi starts
- **Deferred**: Progress messages collected during async execution
- **Final**: Single batched notification with all results when complete

**Processes tracked (in order):**
1. **docs** — Load project docs + always-on skills (sync)
2. **ib** — IB reconciliation (async, runs first)
3. **free_trade** — Free trade scan (async, waits for IB to complete)
4. **daemon** — Monitor daemon status check (sync)
5. **x_{account}** — X account scans (async, parallel)

**Status indicators:**
- `✓` success — Process completed normally
- `⚠️` warning — Process skipped or has issues (triggers auto-reconciliation if IB)
- `❌` error — Process failed

**Implementation:** Uses `StartupTracker` class with TDD (14 tests)

### IB Reconciliation (Auto-Log)
- Script: `scripts/ib_reconcile.py`
- Runs at Pi startup (non-blocking)
- Detects new trades, new positions, closed positions
- Output: `data/reconciliation.json`
- **Auto-Log**: When `needs_attention: true`, immediately:
  1. Add trades to `trade_log.json`
  2. Update `docs/status.md`
  3. Clear `needs_attention` flag
- **No user prompt required** — this is automatic

### Data Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `data/trade_log.json` | Executed trades (13 entries) |

### Ticker Detail Modal (NEW)
Click any ticker across all 6 table sections → 720px modal with:
- **Price Bar**: Real-time bid/ask/mid/spread/last/volume/day-change. Option positions show option-level prices (not underlying). Spreads show net mid computed from leg prices.
- **Position Tab**: Structure, direction, qty, entry date, avg entry, last price, entry cost, market value, unrealized P&L, expiry, target/stop. Multi-leg positions show individual legs.
- **Order Tab**: If open orders exist → inline modify/cancel (reuses `useOrderActions`). Below that, new order form with BUY/SELL, qty, limit price with BID/MID/ASK quick-set (option-level), TIF, 2-step confirm. Combo positions show "close via Orders page" message.
- **News Tab**: UW headlines with date, source, MAJOR badge, external link icon.
- **Ratings Tab**: Analyst recommendation, ratings bar, price targets, recent changes (via `fetch_analyst_ratings.py`).
- **Context**: `TickerDetailContext` provides `openTicker()`/`closeTicker()` app-wide. Prices, portfolio, orders synced via refs (no re-renders).
- **API Routes**: `/api/ticker/news` (UW proxy), `/api/ticker/ratings` (Python script), `/api/orders/place` (IB order placement via `ib_place_order.py`).

## Known Issues
1. ~~`fetch_ticker.py` rate-limited~~ **FIXED** — Uses UW dark pool API
2. ~~`fetch_options.py` placeholder data~~ **FIXED** — Uses UW chain + flow
3. ~~Options no real-time prices~~ **FIXED** — IB realtime server supports options
4. Flex Query sometimes times out on IB server side (retry usually works)
5. ~~`ib_order_manage.py modify` Error 103~~ **FIXED** — Reconnects as original clientId before placeOrder
6. ~~`ib_order_manage.py cancel` Error 10147~~ **FIXED** — Same clientId mismatch as modify; cancel now reconnects as original placer
7. ~~Options showing $-1.00 after hours~~ **FIXED** — IB returns -1 sentinel for LAST tick when market closed; normalizeNumber() now rejects negatives, reqMarketDataType(4) requests frozen data
8. ~~Day Chg % -206% for PLTR spread~~ **FIXED** — `getOptionDailyChg()` was dividing daily P&L by entry cost instead of yesterday's close value. Spread entry $0.52 but close $8.50 → 16x inflation. See CLAUDE.md "Calculations" section.
9. ~~Spread orders showing underlying stock price~~ **FIXED** — BAG orders now compute net mid from portfolio legs (`resolveOrderLastPrice()`). Order form BID/MID/ASK buttons now use option-level prices via `tickerPriceData` prop.
10. ~~Ticker detail modal not showing open orders on non-orders pages~~ **FIXED** — `useOrders()` now always reads cached orders on mount; IB auto-sync still only on /orders page.
11. ~~discover.py crash: KeyError 'ticker' in watchlist~~ **FIXED** — `get_existing_tickers()` handles both `ticker` and `symbol` keys. Normalize all watchlist entries to `ticker`.
12. ~~News tab fails silently when UW rate-limited~~ **FIXED** — `/api/ticker/news` route now falls back to Yahoo Finance RSS when UW returns 429. Both sources handle failure gracefully with user-facing error message.
13. ~~RatingsTab shows raw/empty data from UW API~~ **FIXED** — Complete rewrite to properly map nested UW response structure (`ratings.buy`, `target_price.mean`, `upgrade_downgrade_history`). Now shows buy/sell percentages, visual distribution bar, price targets with upside/downside calculation, and analyst actions table with firm name and grade.
14. **Data normalization rule**: All data files (watchlist.json, discover.json) must use `"ticker"` as the canonical key, never `"symbol"`. Scripts that read these files handle both for backward compatibility.
