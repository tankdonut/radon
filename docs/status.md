## Recent Commits
- 2026-03-18 — **feat: Complete Order System Migration (Steps 3-5).** ModifyOrderModal: price strip + leg pills for combos. OrderConfirmSummary: total cost, max gain/loss for spreads in confirm step. Standardized leg pills across ChainBuilder, OrderTab, ModifyModal. 137 order tests.
- 2026-03-18 — **feat: Integrate OrderPriceStrip and OrderLegPills into OptionsChainTab.** OrderBuilder now shows price strip (BID/MID/ASK/SPREAD) for combo orders when prices available, plus colored leg pills with +/− direction. 137 order tests (21 new migration tests).
- 2026-03-18 — **feat: Unified order component system.** Created `web/lib/order/` with 8 reusable components (OrderPriceStrip, OrderLegPills, OrderPriceButtons, OrderActionToggle, OrderTifSelector, OrderQuantityInput, OrderPriceInput, OrderConfirmSummary), 2 hooks (useOrderPrices, useOrderValidation), shared types. Analysis doc identifies 5 placement locations, 3 viewing locations, 2 modification locations with feature gaps. 116 order tests.
- 2026-03-18 — **ui: Order entry UX improvements.** Form now appears ABOVE open orders (visible without scrolling). Added spread price strip showing BID/MID/ASK/SPREAD at top of combo form. Replaced leg list with compact colored pills (+/− prefixes, green/red backgrounds). 53 order tests.
- 2026-03-18 — **feat: Add input validation for order placement.** API now rejects zero/negative quantity and limitPrice before sending to IB. Prevents IB errors and provides clearer user feedback. 4 new validation tests.
- 2026-03-18 — **fix: Natural market bid/ask in ALL combo order forms.** Extended fix to ComboOrderForm (OrderTab.tsx) and ModifyOrderModal BAG resolution. Same bug as computeNetOptionQuote — using sign * bid/ask produces mid-mid instead of true marketable spread. Now: BUY legs pay ASK/receive BID, SELL legs receive BID/pay ASK. **101 order tests** (93 passed, 8 skipped).
- 2026-03-18 — **fix: Correct natural market bid/ask for combo orders + intraday DP interpolation.** `computeNetOptionQuote` was computing mid-to-mid spread instead of true marketable bid/ask. Now correctly calculates: BUY spread = pay ASK on long legs, receive BID on short legs; SELL spread = receive BID on long legs, pay ASK on short legs. Verified end-to-end in options chain UI (bear call spread shows BID < MID < ASK). Also added intraday dark pool interpolation for partial-day data. **95 new order tests** (44 reliability, 25 E2E, 26 unit). `computeNetOptionQuote` was computing mid-to-mid spread instead of true marketable bid/ask. Now correctly calculates: BUY spread = pay ASK on long legs, receive BID on short legs; SELL spread = receive BID on long legs, pay ASK on short legs. Verified end-to-end in options chain UI (bear call spread shows BID < MID < ASK). Also added intraday dark pool interpolation for partial-day data. **95 new order tests** (44 reliability, 25 E2E, 26 unit).
- 2026-03-18 — **fix: Share PnL entry/exit data for multi-day trades.** `positionGroupShareData()` now falls back to portfolio position data when opening fills aren't in today's executed orders (position opened on prior day). Entry price from `leg.avg_cost`, entry time from `entry_date`. Share image now correctly shows ENTRY/EXIT with PST times, no commission. 8 unit tests + 5 E2E tests.
- 2026-03-17 — **fix: Normalize open-order combo net credit by leg size for ratio spreads.** 1x2 risk-reversal entries (for example, short puts + long calls) now compute true weighted net credit in the combo last-price cell; added regression coverage in `web/tests/open-order-combos.test.ts`.
- 2026-03-17 — **ui: Update share PnL defaults and card emphasis.** X/share card rendering now scales single-value hero text larger (`$` or `%` only) while default share toggle state is now `%` only for cleaner default image output.
- 2026-03-16 — **feat: News & Catalysts milestone (M1D) — fetch_news.py classifies headlines for material catalysts (buyback, M&A, earnings, FDA, etc.) and sentiment. Integrated into evaluate.py as parallel milestone. Context-only (not a gate) but surfaces in edge determination output for operator judgment. CRM's $25B buyback now visible in evaluation.**
- 2026-03-14 — **fix: Post-bundle-optimization audit — reconnect 27 missing CSS classes, remove 4 orphaned rules, add 4 brand variables.** E2E browser verification (9 pages, dark+light themes) confirmed no visual regressions. Fixed 14 component classNames pointing to pre-rename names (e.g., `mono`→`fm`, `metric-value`→`mv`, `modal-backdrop`→`mb135`). Restored 10 accidentally deleted CSS rules. Removed 3 dead className refs. Added `--signal-deep`, `--extreme`, `--neutral`, `--line-grid` to both theme blocks. Fixed `--line-grid` which was referenced in ~15 rules but never defined.
- 2026-03-14 — **perf: Web bundle size optimization — 1124KB → 911KB raw (−19.0%), 281KB → 264KB gzip (−6.0%), 80KB → 56KB CSS (−30.0%).** 38 experiments across 4 sessions. CSS rule merging (−6KB CSS), class name shortening campaign (~300 classes renamed to 2-4 char abbreviations), orphan CSS removal, dead code cleanup, Google Fonts @import → `<link>`, template literal simplification. 30 commits squashed.
- 2026-03-13 — **feat: Ticker detail page — modal → dedicated route refactor.** Ticker detail is now a first-class page at `/{TICKER}` (e.g., `/AAPL`) with bookmarkable tabs (`?tab=chain`), browser back/forward, case normalization (`/aapl` → `/AAPL`), and 404 for invalid paths. Extracted `TickerDetailContent` from modal, created `TickerWorkspace` (URL tab sync), shared `TickerLink`, `useTickerNav` hook. Simplified `TickerDetailContext` (URL-driven). 24 unit + 8 E2E tests.
- 2026-03-13 09:31:00 -0700 — **fix: refresh `/api/performance` for the current ET session. The route now refreshes `portfolio.json` through `ibSync` before rebuilding when the cached snapshot still points at a prior ET session, and preserves the cached performance payload instead of rewriting from stale inputs if that portfolio refresh fails. Locked with Vitest route regressions.**
- 2026-03-13 09:17:01 -0700 — **fix: keep `/performance` reconstructed YTD aligned with portfolio sync. Added a shared freshness contract, made the performance panel revalidate as soon as the shell portfolio sync advances, and locked the handoff with Vitest plus Playwright regressions.**
- 2026-03-12 10:45:00 -0700 — **fix: tighten `/regime` operator telemetry. Added a shared responsive strip renderer (`5-up -> 3x2 -> stacked telemetry rail`), stacked the CRI detail panels earlier on narrow widths, and made `NORMALIZED DIVERGENCE` actionable plus hoverable. Locked with Vitest and Playwright coverage.**
- 2026-03-12 08:43:57 -0700 — **fix: unify quote telemetry across ticker, instrument, and modify-order views. Shared calculator/renderer now show `BID`, `MID`, `ASK`, `SPREAD`, with spread rendered as raw quote width plus midpoint percent. Locked with unit and Playwright regressions.**
- 2026-03-12 07:14:00 -0700 — **fix: All-long combo positions (e.g., AAOI 2x long calls) classified as "complex" → silently dropped from web UI. Fix: ib_sync.py classifies all-long combos as "defined"; UI fallback includes "complex" in undefined bucket. 13 new tests.**
- 2026-03-11 13:00:00 -0400 — **feat: High-throughput optimization — parallel scanning (15 workers), atomic state (SHA-256), batched WS (100ms flush), vectorized Kelly+Greeks (NumPy), resilient IB client (auto-reconnect + sub recovery), pacing/invalid contract handling. 96 new tests.**
- 2026-03-11 12:15:00 -0400 — **fix: Rebuild `/regime` RVOL history from CRI cache, prefer richer CRI artifacts, and refresh post-close CRI caches atomically**
- 2026-03-11 11:00:00 -0400 — **feat: Regime strip day change arrows, 20-session dual charts, portfolio arrow alignment, short leg delta sign fix**
- 2026-03-11 10:30:00 -0400 — **fix: Regime page showing "MARKET CLOSED" during market hours — corrupt CRI cache files + stale market_open override**

- **Entry**: 03-12 @ $0.98 net debit | **Structure**: 222 contracts, Apr 17 expiry (35 DTE)

- **Breakeven**: OXY ≤ $54.02 (oil needs to drop ~14%)
- **Max gain at**: OXY ≤ $50 (oil needs to drop ~35%)
- **Thesis**: ⚠️ THESIS ONLY — No institutional flow confirmation. Convexity and risk management pass. Edge gate marked as thesis-based override by operator.

### NVDA — 2026-03-18 ⛔ NO_TRADE
- **Decision**: NO_TRADE
- **Failing Gate**: EDGE (Milestone 4)
- **📊 Data as of**: 2026-03-18 12:47 PM PT (LIVE — 97% of trading day)
- **Reason**: Alternating accumulation/distribution pattern. No sustained direction.
  - Mar 18: ACCUMULATION (57.5%, 15.0 strength) — weak
  - Mar 17: NEUTRAL (47.9%, 0 strength)
  - Mar 16: **DISTRIBUTION** (36.9%, 26.2 strength) — broke streak
  - Mar 13: ACCUMULATION (82.1%, 64.2 strength)
  - Mar 12: ACCUMULATION (67.8%, 35.5 strength)
  - Mar 11: ACCUMULATION (92.1%, 84.3 strength) — peak
- **Aggregate**: 71.4% buy ratio, 42.8 strength (below 50 threshold)
- **What failed**: Sustained days = 0 (Mar 16 DISTRIBUTION broke the Mar 11-13 streak). Recent strength 15.0 (need >70). Pattern matches AAPL/NFLX — institutions accumulated then stopped.
- **Analysts**: 93.8% Buy, $268 target (+47.9%), 64 analysts — very bullish consensus
- **News**: LEAN_BULLISH, 5 AI catalyst mentions
- **Action**: WATCH. Strong fundamentals but flow pattern broken. Re-evaluate if 3+ consecutive days of accumulation resume.

### PLTR — 2026-03-17 ⛔ NO_TRADE
- **Decision**: NO_TRADE
- **Failing Gate**: EDGE (Milestone 4)
- **📊 Data as of**: 2026-03-17 07:22 AM PT (LIVE)
- **Reason**: Aggregate flow strength 40.2 below threshold (need >50). Only 1 sustained day. Recent strength 26.7 (need >70 for alternative). Alternating pattern: Mar 10/12 strong (80%+) then Mar 16 NEUTRAL breaks streak.
- **Dark Pool**: 70.1% aggregate buy ratio, ACCUMULATION direction, but inconsistent intensity
- **OI Changes**: $50.2M total (0 MASSIVE, 1 LARGE, 15 SIGNIFICANT)
- **News**: Strong AI catalyst pipeline — Nvidia, GE Aerospace, LG CNS partnerships
- **Action**: WATCH. Re-evaluate if 3+ consecutive days of accumulation (70%+) materialize.

### OXY — 2026-03-12 ✅ EXECUTED (Thesis Trade)
- **Decision**: TRADE
- **Structure**: Bear Put Spread P$55/P$50 Apr 17 (222 contracts)
- **Fill**: $0.98 net debit ($21,756 total)
- **Gates**: Convexity 4.1:1 ✅, Risk 1.75% ✅, Edge: THESIS ONLY ⚠️
- **📊 Data as of**: 2026-03-12 09:33 AM PT (LIVE)
- **Thesis**: Bearish oil macro view. OXY selected after comprehensive vehicle comparison (12 tickers evaluated). No dark pool distribution signal — institutions are NOT selling oil/energy names. Flow shows mixed/accumulation on OXY. Operator accepted thesis-only edge.
- **Vehicle analysis**: USO (illiquid options), SCO (leveraged decay), XLE (low beta), XOP (DP accumulation = wrong way), COP (low beta), APA (1 strike available). OXY had highest usable oil beta (0.43) with best option liquidity ($0.03-0.08 spreads).

### IBM — 2026-03-05 ⛔ NO_TRADE
- **Decision**: NO_TRADE
- **Failing Gate**: KELLY (Milestone 6) — Edge passed, Structure failed
- **📊 Data as of**: 2026-03-05 2:01 PM PT (LIVE — all milestones fetched fresh)
- **Edge PASSED**: 5 consecutive days of accumulation (Feb 27–Mar 5), today is STRONGEST day (83.1%)
  - Feb 27: 73.3% → Mar 02: 80.4% → Mar 03: 82.3% → Mar 04: 81.7% → **Mar 05: 83.1%** (building)
  - Aggregate 76.4%, strength 52.8 (threshold: 50 ✅)
  - Sustained 5 days (threshold: 3 ✅)
- **Options conflict is ARTIFICIAL**: 29.58x P/C ratio driven by deep ITM puts ($300/$305 strikes on $257 stock = synthetic/hedging). Actual flow alerts: $3.85M calls vs $2.39M puts = call-heavy. Recent bias BULLISH.
- **Why no trade — Kelly negative on ALL structures tested**:
  - $265/$285 spread: R:R 2.11:1 ✅, P(ITM)=0.48, conditional value=$10.50, EV=$5.04 < cost $6.43 → **Kelly -25%**
  - $270/$285 spread: R:R 3.18:1 ✅, P(ITM)=0.40, EV=$3.80 < cost $3.59 → **Kelly -22%**
  - $275/$290 OTM: R:R higher but P(ITM) too low → **Kelly -9%**
- **Root cause**: IBM is a low-vol stock (HV20 ~37%, IV rank 42). Options are fairly priced for the expected move. The 5-day DP edge adds ~5-8% to ITM probability, but that's insufficient to overcome the option premium. IBM doesn't produce convex payoffs at current IV levels.
- **Context**: Seasonality FAVORABLE (March 75% win rate). Analysts 60% Buy, $276 target (+7.5%). OI changes all MODERATE ($4.7M total, no massive signals).
- **Ticker Verified**: YES — IBM, Technology, $250/share
- **Lesson**: A genuine DP signal on a low-vol name can still fail Kelly. Edge ≠ trade. Convexity requires sufficient vol to create asymmetric payoffs.
- **Action**: WATCH only. Would need IBM IV to compress significantly (IVR < 20) or DP flow to intensify (90%+ buy ratio) before reconsidering.

### NFLX (Netflix) - 2026-03-05 ⛔ NO_TRADE
- **Decision**: NO_TRADE
- **Failing Gate**: EDGE (Milestone 4)
- **📊 Data as of**: 2026-03-05 12:32 PM PT (LIVE — all milestones fetched fresh)
- **Reason**: Accumulation cycle BROKE TODAY. Feb 27–Mar 4 showed 4-day sustained accumulation (84–93% buy). But **Mar 5 (TODAY): NEUTRAL (54.4%, strength 0.0)** — broke the streak.
  - Feb 26: DISTRIBUTION (37.5%)
  - Feb 27: ACCUMULATION (92.5%, 85.1 strength)
  - Mar 2: ACCUMULATION (92.7%, 85.4 strength)
  - Mar 3: ACCUMULATION (85.0%, 69.9 strength)
  - Mar 4: ACCUMULATION (84.4%, 68.9 strength)
  - **Mar 5 (TODAY): NEUTRAL (54.4%, 0.0 strength)** ← streak broken
  - Sustained consecutive days = **0** (need 3+)
  - Recent strength = 0.0 (need >70 for alternative criterion)
- **What passed**: Aggregate strength 65.4 (>50), $39M in OI changes (1 MASSIVE signal), chain data available, 82.7% aggregate buy ratio
- **What failed**: Today's neutral print resets sustained days to 0. Same pattern as AAPL — institutions accumulated Feb 27–Mar 4 then stopped.
- **GARCH context**: HV20 (57.9%) − LEAP IV (43.3%) = +14.5 pts → LEAP vega is cheap. But without sustained DP flow, no edge to trigger the trade.
- **Ticker Verified**: YES — Netflix, Communication Services, $98.45
- **Action**: Add to WATCH. Re-evaluate if sustained accumulation resumes (3+ consecutive days). Also monitor for standalone LEAP IV play if HV20−IV gap widens further.

### AAPL (Apple Inc.) - 2026-03-05 ⛔ NO_TRADE
- **Decision**: NO_TRADE
- **Failing Gate**: EDGE (Milestone 4)
- **📊 Data as of**: 2026-03-05 11:00 AM PT (LIVE — all milestones fetched fresh)
- **Reason**: Accumulation cycle FADED. Feb 27 monster print (99.3%, $3.17B) was genuine but has not sustained:
  - Mar 3: DISTRIBUTION (25.6%) — broke accumulation streak
  - Mar 4: Weak accumulation (74.2%, strength 48.4)
  - **Mar 5 (TODAY): NEUTRAL (55.2%, strength 10.5)** — signal fading
  - Sustained consecutive days = **0** (need 3+)
  - Recent strength = 10.5 (need >70 for alternative criterion)
- **What passed**: Aggregate strength 62.7 (>50), $11.8M MASSIVE OI at Apr $270C, chain LEAN_BULLISH (P/C 0.53x), seasonality FAVORABLE (65%), analysts 75.9% Buy
- **What failed**: No sustained direction from most recent day. Recent flow alerts turning BEARISH. Accumulation cycle appears completed — institutional buying peaked Feb 27 and is winding down.
- **Critical lesson**: Without today's DP data (Mar 5), this would have PASSED edge. Fetching fresh data prevented a trade against a fading signal.
- **Seasonality**: FAVORABLE (March 65% win rate, +3.8% avg)
- **Analyst Ratings**: 29 analysts, 75.9% Buy, $288 target (+9.6%)
- **Ticker Verified**: YES — Apple Inc., Technology, $3.85T market cap
- **Action**: Add to WATCH. Re-evaluate if sustained accumulation resumes (3+ consecutive days).

### GOOG - 2026-03-04 ✅ EXECUTED
- **Decision**: TRADE
- **Structure**: Bull Call Spread $315/$340 (44 contracts)
- **Fill**: $6.26 net debit ($27,544 total)
- **Gates**: All three passed (Convexity 3.0:1, Edge 89.7 strength, Risk 2.46%)
- **Thesis**: Extraordinary institutional accumulation confirmed by bullish options flow

### AMD - 2026-03-03 (LEAP IV Scan Follow-up)
- **Decision**: NO_TRADE
- **Failing Gate**: EDGE
- **Reason**: IV mispricing confirmed (HV20 85.9% vs LEAP IV ~60%, +27% gap). However, dark pool accumulation cycle appears COMPLETED — Feb 24 distribution → Feb 26-27 strong accumulation → Mar 2 reverted to neutral. Aggregate strength only 19.5 (need >50). Options flow LEAN_BEARISH (P/C 1.49x) with put buying. Price already rallied from ~$170 to ~$198 during accumulation window.
- **Seasonality**: NEUTRAL (March 50% win rate)
- **Ticker Verified**: YES
- **Note**: Existing AMD LEAP position already in portfolio (see trade #5). Current flow suggests edge has faded — monitor for position review.

### APO (Apollo Global Management) - 2026-03-05
- **Decision**: NO_TRADE
- **Failing Gate**: EDGE
- **Reason**: Dark pool aggregate strength 10.3 (need >50). 3 of 5 days NEUTRAL. 0 consecutive days sustained direction. Options flow is BEARISH (P/C 2.05x, $8.2M put premium, sweep activity on Jun $105 puts), but dark pool does NOT confirm distribution — flow is neutral, not selling. Without DP confirmation, put buying could be hedging, not directional. OI changes all MODERATE (<$1M per position, $3.08M total). No massive institutional positioning in either direction.
- **Seasonality**: UNFAVORABLE (March 29% win rate, -4.2% avg return)
- **Analyst Ratings**: Unavailable (rate limited)
- **Ticker Verified**: YES — Apollo Global Management, Financial Services, $63.5B market cap

### RMBS - 2026-03-03
- **Decision**: NO_TRADE
- **Failing Gate**: EDGE
- **Reason**: Alternating accumulation/distribution pattern. Aggregate strength 42.0 (need >50). Only 1 day of recent accumulation.
- **Seasonality**: FAVORABLE (March 65% win rate)
- **Ticker Verified**: YES

### TSLA - 2026-03-03
- **Decision**: NO_TRADE
- **Failing Gate**: EDGE
- **Reason**: Accumulation cycle appears completed. 3 days accumulation followed by neutral reversal. Aggregate strength only 20.2.
- **Seasonality**: UNFAVORABLE (March 47% win rate)
- **Ticker Verified**: YES

### MSFT - 2026-03-04 ✅ PENDING EXECUTION
- **Decision**: TRADE (pending user confirmation)
- **Structure**: Long LEAP Call $575 (Jan 2027)
- **Edge**: VERIFIED via OI change analysis
  - $95M institutional LEAP call purchase confirmed
  - $625 Call: +100,458 OI, $51M premium
  - $575 Call: +50,443 OI, $45M premium
  - $675 Call: +50,148 OI, $15M premium (short leg)
- **Flow Alerts**: Did NOT show this — discovered via OI change endpoint
- **Dark Pool**: 97-98% buy ratio Mar 2-3, strength 94-96
- **Technical**: 14-week RSI at lowest since 2008
- **Kelly**: 12.6% optimal → 2.5% allocation ($29,915)
- **R:R**: 5.7:1
- **Note**: This evaluation led to discovery of OI change methodology

### MSFT - 2026-02-28
- **Decision**: NO_TRADE
- **Failing Gate**: EDGE
- **Reason**: 4 days accumulation followed by massive Friday distribution (0.8% buy ratio). Pattern = completed round-trip.
- **Ticker Verified**: YES

## Infrastructure

### Startup Protocol
The Pi startup extension (`.pi/extensions/startup-protocol.ts`) automatically runs checks with **full visibility**:

**Output Format (two-phase notification):**
```
🚀 Startup: Running 4 checks...     <- IMMEDIATE on startup
```
Then when async tasks complete:
```
[1/4] ✓ Loaded: Spec, Plans, Runbook, Status, Context Engineering
[2/4] ✓ IB trades in sync
[3/4] ✓ Monitor daemon running
[4/4] ✓ No free trade opportunities
✅ Startup complete (4/4 passed)
```

**⚠️ Auto-Reconciliation Rule:**
When startup shows `⚠️ IB: N new trades`, **IMMEDIATELY**:
1. Read `data/reconciliation.json`
2. Log each trade to `data/trade_log.json`
3. Update `docs/status.md`
4. Clear reconciliation flag
5. Validate JSON

**Do NOT wait for user prompt — this is automatic.**

**Notification Strategy:**
- **Immediate**: Show check count as soon as Pi starts
- **Deferred**: Progress messages collected during async execution
- **Final**: Single batched notification with all results when complete

**Processes tracked (in order):**
1. **docs** — Load project docs + always-on skills (sync)
2. **ib** — IB reconciliation (async, runs first)
3. **free_trade** — Free trade scan (async, waits for IB to complete)
4. **daemon** — Monitor daemon status check (sync)
5. **x_{account}** — X account scans (async, parallel)

**Status indicators:**
- `✓` success — Process completed normally
- `⚠️` warning — Process skipped or has issues (triggers auto-reconciliation if IB)
- `❌` error — Process failed

**Implementation:** Uses `StartupTracker` class with TDD (14 tests)

### IB Reconciliation (Auto-Log)
- Script: `scripts/ib_reconcile.py`
- Runs at Pi startup (non-blocking)
- Detects new trades, new positions, closed positions
- Output: `data/reconciliation.json`
- **Auto-Log**: When `needs_attention: true`, immediately:
  1. Add trades to `trade_log.json`
  2. Update `docs/status.md`
  3. Clear `needs_attention` flag
- **No user prompt required** — this is automatic

### Data Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `data/trade_log.json` | Executed trades (13 entries) |
| `data/portfolio.json` | Open positions from IB |
| `data/reconciliation.json` | IB sync discrepancies |
| `data/watchlist.json` | Tickers under surveillance |
| `data/discover.json` | Cached discover scan results (auto-refreshed) |

### Ticker Detail Page (`/{TICKER}`)
Navigate to any ticker via search (CMD+K), ticker links in tables, or direct URL → dedicated page at `/{TICKER}` with 8 tabs:
- **Price Bar**: Real-time bid/ask/mid/spread/last/volume/day-change. Option positions show option-level prices (not underlying). Spreads show net mid computed from leg prices.
- **Company Tab**: Fundamentals, sector, description from UW.
- **Book Tab**: Level 2 order book data.
- **Chain Tab**: Options chain with expiry selection, strike filtering.
- **Position Tab**: Structure, direction, qty, entry date, avg entry, last price, entry cost, market value, unrealized P&L, expiry, target/stop. Multi-leg positions show individual legs.
- **Order Tab**: If open orders exist → inline modify/cancel (reuses `useOrderActions`). Below that, new order form with BUY/SELL, qty, limit price with BID/MID/ASK quick-set (option-level), TIF, 2-step confirm. Combo positions show "close via Orders page" message.
- **News Tab**: UW headlines with date, source, MAJOR badge, external link icon.
- **Ratings Tab**: Analyst recommendation, ratings bar, price targets, recent changes (via `fetch_analyst_ratings.py`).
- **Seasonality Tab**: Monthly seasonality from UW with EquityClock Vision fallback.
- **URL ownership**: Active tab persisted as `?tab=chain`, position ID as `?posId=123`. Bookmarkable, shareable, no lost state on refresh. `/aapl` auto-redirects to `/AAPL`. Invalid paths return 404.
- **Architecture**: `[ticker]/page.tsx` (server validation) → `WorkspaceShell` → `TickerWorkspace` (URL tab sync) → `TickerDetailContent` (8 tabs). Navigation via `useTickerNav` hook and shared `TickerLink` component. `TickerDetailContext` provides `setActiveTicker()`/`setActivePositionId()` URL-driven state. Prices, portfolio, orders synced via refs (no re-renders).
- **API Routes**: `/api/ticker/news` (UW proxy), `/api/ticker/ratings` (Python script), `/api/orders/place` (IB order placement via `ib_place_order.py`).

## Known Issues
1. ~~`fetch_ticker.py` rate-limited~~ **FIXED** — Uses UW dark pool API
2. ~~`fetch_options.py` placeholder data~~ **FIXED** — Uses UW chain + flow
3. ~~Options no real-time prices~~ **FIXED** — IB realtime server supports options
4. Flex Query sometimes times out on IB server side (retry usually works)
5. ~~`ib_order_manage.py modify` Error 103~~ **FIXED** — Reconnects as original clientId before placeOrder
6. ~~`ib_order_manage.py cancel` Error 10147~~ **FIXED** — Same clientId mismatch as modify; cancel now reconnects as original placer
7. ~~Options showing $-1.00 after hours~~ **FIXED** — IB returns -1 sentinel for LAST tick when market closed; normalizeNumber() now rejects negatives, reqMarketDataType(4) requests frozen data
8. ~~Day Chg % -206% for PLTR spread~~ **FIXED** — `getOptionDailyChg()` was dividing daily P&L by entry cost instead of yesterday's close value. Spread entry $0.52 but close $8.50 → 16x inflation. See CLAUDE.md "Calculations" section.
9. ~~Spread orders showing underlying stock price~~ **FIXED** — BAG orders now compute net mid from portfolio legs (`resolveOrderLastPrice()`). Order form BID/MID/ASK buttons now use option-level prices via `tickerPriceData` prop.
10. ~~Ticker detail modal not showing open orders on non-orders pages~~ **FIXED** — `useOrders()` now always reads cached orders on mount; IB auto-sync still only on /orders page.
11. ~~discover.py crash: KeyError 'ticker' in watchlist~~ **FIXED** — `get_existing_tickers()` handles both `ticker` and `symbol` keys. Normalize all watchlist entries to `ticker`.
12. ~~News tab fails silently when UW rate-limited~~ **FIXED** — `/api/ticker/news` route now falls back to Yahoo Finance RSS when UW returns 429. Both sources handle failure gracefully with user-facing error message.
13. ~~RatingsTab shows raw/empty data from UW API~~ **FIXED** — Complete rewrite to properly map nested UW response structure (`ratings.buy`, `target_price.mean`, `upgrade_downgrade_history`). Now shows buy/sell percentages, visual distribution bar, price targets with upside/downside calculation, and analyst actions table with firm name and grade.
14. **Data normalization rule**: All data files (watchlist.json, discover.json) must use `"ticker"` as the canonical key, never `"symbol"`. Scripts that read these files handle both for backward compatibility.
15. ~~CRI/VCG/GARCH/LEAP scanners skip UW, fall back IB → Yahoo~~ **FIXED** — All scanners now use IB → UW → Yahoo priority. UW OHLC serves stocks/ETFs. Yahoo only for VIX/VVIX (indices UW cannot serve).
16. ~~All-long combo positions missing from web UI~~ **FIXED** — `ib_sync.py` classified all-long combos (e.g., AAOI 2x long calls at different strikes) as `risk_profile: "complex"`. The web UI only rendered `defined`/`undefined`/`equity` buckets, silently dropping `complex`. Fix: (a) all-long combos now classified as `"defined"` with descriptive names (`Long Call Combo`, `Long Put Combo`, `Long Combo`); (b) UI fallback includes `"complex"` in undefined bucket. Tests: `test_all_long_combo.py` (8), `complex-risk-profile.test.ts` (5).
