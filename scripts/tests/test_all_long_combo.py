"""
TDD tests for all-long combo detection in ib_sync.py.

Bug: A combo with 2 long calls (e.g., AAOI 25x $105C + 25x $130C) is classified
as risk_profile="complex" instead of "defined". The PortfolioSections component
only renders "defined", "undefined", and "equity" — so "complex" positions are
silently dropped from the UI.

Red/Green workflow:
1. Write failing tests that reproduce the bug → RED
2. Fix detect_structure_type to handle all-long combos → GREEN
3. Fix UI to include "complex" in a fallback bucket → GREEN
