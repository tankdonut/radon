  <p><strong>1. MSFT is your single biggest risk:</strong> $468K equity (42% of bankroll) with no options hedge. In the base case alone you lose ~$99K on MSFT. Consider buying protective puts or selling covered calls.</p>
  <p><strong>2. LEAP vega is your hidden strength:</strong> SOFI (+$53K), ETHA (+$13K), AMD (+$11K), WULF (+$8K), AAOI (+$16K) collectively generate +$101K in gains despite their stocks declining. IV expansion on LEAPs is a powerful natural hedge.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Oil/Commodity names work as diversifiers:</strong> EC (+$13K), USAX (+$4K), NAK (+$3K), ILF (+$4K) = ~$24K from commodity exposure. This is genuine diversification.</p>
  <p><strong>4. SPXU hedge is undersized:</strong> $2.9K position produces only ~$6K profit vs $170K+ in losses. Hedge ratio is ~0.3%. Consider 10-20x sizing.</p>
  <p><strong>5. Undefined risk positions face assignment risk:</strong> EWY (5 DTE!), APO, IWM short puts go ITM. EWY $130 put at $123 = deep ITM with 5 days to expiry.</p>
  <p><strong>6. Defined risk is working:</strong> PLTR spread loses max $2,620 (not $30K). TMUS loses $12.6K (not $58K as v1 falsely showed). Spreads cap your downside as designed.</p>
  <p><strong>7. Net portfolio impact is manageable:</strong> Base case -$41K (-3.7%) on a $1.1M portfolio. The diversification between oil winners, LEAP vega, and defined risk keeps losses contained.</p>
