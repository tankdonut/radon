## Session: Fix Signed Entry Basis For Closed Combo Share PnL (2026-03-17)

### Goal
Fix the `/orders` share-PnL card for closed combo positions so the entry price and return percentage use the exact signed opening cash flow of the matching legs, not an unrelated same-symbol combo BAG envelope. Closed risk reversals opened for a net credit must render a negative entry price and a percentage consistent with that signed basis.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the closed-combo share-PnL basis path and identify why a same-symbol BAG open can override the true opening leg cash flow) depends_on: []
- T2 (Add a red regression at both the unit layer and `/orders` browser flow for a closed AAOI-style risk reversal with unrelated same-symbol BAG history) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Implement leg-aware basis matching so the share card derives signed entry basis from the exact opening option legs before computing return percent) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run focused Vitest and Playwright verification, then record review notes and the prevention lesson) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the closed-combo share-PnL basis path and identify why a same-symbol BAG open can override the true opening leg cash flow
- [x] T2 Add a red regression at both the unit layer and `/orders` browser flow for a closed AAOI-style risk reversal with unrelated same-symbol BAG history
- [x] T3 Implement leg-aware basis matching so the share card derives signed entry basis from the exact opening option legs before computing return percent
- [x] T4 Run focused Vitest and Playwright verification, then record review notes and the prevention lesson

### Review
- Root cause: [WorkspaceSections.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/WorkspaceSections.tsx) computed share-PnL basis for any closed combo by grabbing the first non-closing BAG group on the same symbol. When AAOI had an unrelated earlier combo open at `$0.25`, the share card borrowed that unsigned BAG envelope instead of reconstructing the actual `-$0.75` credit from the matching short-put and long-call opening fills.
- Fixed the basis reconstruction in [WorkspaceSections.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/WorkspaceSections.tsx) by matching opening fills to the closing combo's exact option contracts and required quantities, ordering candidates by recency, and deriving signed net cash from the matched opening legs. That yields `entryPrice=-0.75`, `exitPrice=1.00`, and a return percentage based on the true `$1,875` credit basis instead of the unrelated `$625` BAG basis.
- Locked the regression at the unit layer in [share-pnl-position-group.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/share-pnl-position-group.test.ts), which imports the production helper and proves an unrelated same-symbol BAG can no longer override the matching AAOI opening legs.
- Locked the browser path in [share-pnl.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/share-pnl.spec.ts) by stubbing `/orders` data, clicking the real share button on `/orders`, and asserting the outgoing `/api/share/pnl` request now carries `entryPrice=-0.75`, `exitPrice=1`, and the corrected percentage.
- Verification passed with `npx vitest run web/tests/share-pnl-position-group.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/share-pnl.spec.ts --config playwright.no-server.config.ts --grep "signed risk-reversal entry basis"`.

## Session: Fix Missing Chain Quotes For Held Option Legs (2026-03-17)

### Goal
Fix the ticker-detail chain page so option legs that are already held in the portfolio still show bid/mid/ask and builder pricing even when the options API returns dashed expiries. The chain page, order builder, and websocket subscription layer must all resolve those contracts to the same canonical option key.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the chain-tab contract key and subscription path for held position legs, including expiry formatting and duplicate contract handling across portfolio and chain subscriptions) depends_on: []
- T2 (Add failing regression coverage for held position leg quotes on the chain page and the option contract normalization boundary) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Implement the minimal fix so held option legs resolve to the same websocket contract keys as portfolio positions and chain/order-builder lookups) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then update task review and lessons) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the chain-tab contract key and subscription path for held position legs, including expiry formatting and duplicate contract handling across portfolio and chain subscriptions
- [x] T2 Add failing regression coverage for held position leg quotes on the chain page and the option contract normalization boundary
- [x] T3 Implement the minimal fix so held option legs resolve to the same websocket contract keys as portfolio positions and chain/order-builder lookups
- [x] T4 Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then update task review and lessons

### Review
- Root cause: the shared option-contract boundary was inconsistent. Portfolio legs were normalized to `YYYYMMDD`, but the chain page and websocket client could still carry dashed expiries from `/api/options/expirations`. That let held position legs end up with different logical identities depending on where the contract originated, so the chain/order-builder lookup path could miss quotes that were already present in the websocket store.
- Tightened the protocol layer in [pricesProtocol.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/pricesProtocol.ts) with `normalizeOptionExpiry()`, `normalizeOptionContract()`, and `uniqueOptionContracts()`. `optionKey()` now canonicalizes dashed expiries before building the composite key, and the contract list hash now deduplicates logically identical contracts instead of treating dashed and compact expiries as separate subscriptions.
- Updated [usePrices.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/usePrices.ts) and [WorkspaceShell.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/WorkspaceShell.tsx) so the websocket only sees canonical, deduplicated option contracts. That removes held-leg duplication between the portfolio contract set and the visible chain contract set.
- Updated [OptionsChainTab.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/ticker-detail/OptionsChainTab.tsx) so placed option/combo payloads always send normalized expiries back to the order route, keeping the chain builder on the same raw IB contract format as the rest of the app.
- Locked the fix with protocol/unit coverage in [pricesProtocol.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/pricesProtocol.test.ts) and a new mocked-websocket browser regression in [chain-held-leg-prices.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/chain-held-leg-prices.spec.ts). The new browser test proves a CRM held spread still shows bid/mid/ask on the chain page and in the order builder when the options API returns dashed expiries.

## Session: Fix Options-Chain Combo Ratio Pricing And Order Sizing (2026-03-17)

### Goal
Fix the options-chain order builder so ratio combos price correctly in the UI and place correctly sized combo orders. The displayed net credit/debit, notional, top-level combo quantity, and per-leg IB ratios must all reflect the entered leg quantities instead of assuming every combo is 1x1.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the current combo quote helper, options-chain builder, and existing ratio/notional tests to pin down the broken assumptions) depends_on: []
- T2 (Drive the bug red with regression coverage for unequal leg quantities in both quote math and combo order payload construction) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Implement quantity normalization so combo quotes, net notional, and outbound combo ratios all share the same ratio model) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted verification for the updated Vitest and Playwright coverage, then capture review notes and lessons) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current combo quote helper, options-chain builder, and existing ratio/notional tests to pin down the broken assumptions
- [x] T2 Drive the bug red with regression coverage for unequal leg quantities in both quote math and combo order payload construction
- [x] T3 Implement quantity normalization so combo quotes, net notional, and outbound combo ratios all share the same ratio model
- [x] T4 Run targeted verification for the updated Vitest and Playwright coverage, then capture review notes and lessons

### Review
- Root cause: the options-chain builder mixed two incompatible models. The UI stored absolute leg counts (`25` puts / `50` calls), but combo quoting still treated every leg as `1x1` and the POST body hardcoded every IB leg ratio to `1`. That made the displayed net credit wrong and submitted the wrong combo structure.
- Added `normalizeComboOrder()` in [optionsChainUtils.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/optionsChainUtils.ts) to reduce entered leg sizes into `top-level combo quantity + per-leg ratios` via the leg-quantity GCD. A `25x/50x` risk reversal now becomes `quantity: 25` with leg ratios `1` and `2`.
- Updated [OptionsChainTab.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/ticker-detail/OptionsChainTab.tsx) so combo pricing and outbound payload construction both use the normalized combo view. The order builder now quotes the per-combo net credit/debit, keeps the notional as `limitPrice * comboQuantity * 100`, and sends the correct IB leg ratios instead of a hardcoded `1`.
- Fixed [optionsChainUtils.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/optionsChainUtils.ts) so `computeNetOptionQuote()` scales each leg by `leg.quantity`, matching the existing `computeNetPrice()` behavior once the legs are normalized to ratios.
- Replaced the old source-string-only ratio test with real normalization coverage in [chain-combo-ratio.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/chain-combo-ratio.test.ts), expanded helper coverage in [options-chain-utils.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/options-chain-utils.test.ts), and added a browser regression in [ticker-search-chain.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/ticker-search-chain.spec.ts) that proves a manually-priced `25x/50x` risk reversal displays `$0.10` net credit, `$250.00` notional, and submits `{ quantity: 25, ratios: [1, 2] }`.

## Session: Document And Ship The `/api/performance` ET-Session Route Refresh Fix (2026-03-13)

### Goal
Update the operator-facing docs to reflect the stronger `/api/performance` ET-session refresh behavior, then ship the two unpushed performance fixes from `main` and confirm the worktree is clean.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Confirm the active branch and identify the docs that should mention the route-level ET-session refresh contract) depends_on: []
- T2 (Update the selected docs plus the task log for the route-refresh fix and the branch-state correction) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Create a scoped docs-only commit on top of the existing unpushed `main` commits) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Push `main` and confirm the worktree is clean) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Confirm the active branch and identify the docs that should mention the route-level ET-session refresh contract
- [x] T2 Update the selected docs plus the task log for the route-refresh fix and the branch-state correction
- [x] T3 Create a scoped docs-only commit on top of the existing unpushed `main` commits
- [x] T4 Push `main` and confirm the worktree is clean

### Review
- Confirmed the active checkout was already [main](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/.git/HEAD), so there was no branch merge step to perform before shipping the two unpushed performance-fix commits.
- Updated the repo-level product summary in [README.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/README.md) so the `/performance` capability note now captures both halves of the fix: the UI-side portfolio-sync revalidation and the route-side ET-session guard.
- Updated the API contract in [web/README.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/README.md) to state that `GET /api/performance` can refresh `portfolio.json` through `ibSync` when the snapshot is behind the current ET session before rebuilding the YTD performance payload.
- Updated [docs/status.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/docs/status.md) with the new route-fix ship note and the current timestamp, and recorded the branch-state correction in [tasks/lessons.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/tasks/lessons.md).
- Shipped the stack from `main` by pushing the existing code commits plus the docs-only follow-up commit, then verified the worktree returned clean.

## Session: Refresh `/api/performance` Against The Current ET Session Before Rebuild (2026-03-13)

### Goal
Strengthen the `/api/performance` GET route so it does not trust a stale `portfolio.json` snapshot when the current ET session has advanced. If the cached reconstructed performance still points at the prior session, the route should first refresh the portfolio snapshot via the existing IB sync wrapper, then rebuild performance from that fresher portfolio state. If that portfolio refresh fails, the route should preserve the cached performance payload instead of overwriting it from stale inputs.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the leftover route-test diff, the current `/api/performance` route, and the existing `ibSync` wrapper contract before editing code) depends_on: []
- T2 (Drive the route regressions red for current-session lag and portfolio-refresh failure handling) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Implement the minimal route fix so GET refreshes portfolio first when the cached performance lags the current ET session) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted Vitest verification, capture review notes, and create a separate scoped commit) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the leftover route-test diff, the current `/api/performance` route, and the existing `ibSync` wrapper contract before editing code
- [x] T2 Drive the route regressions red for current-session lag and portfolio-refresh failure handling
- [x] T3 Implement the minimal route fix so GET refreshes portfolio first when the cached performance lags the current ET session
- [x] T4 Run targeted Vitest verification, capture review notes, and create a separate scoped commit

### Review
- Root cause: [route.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/api/performance/route.ts) only compared `performance.json` to the current `portfolio.json`. If both caches were still on yesterday’s session while today’s ET session had already started, the route treated them as mutually consistent and skipped the rebuild. The leftover route tests correctly captured the stronger contract: before rebuilding from a prior-session portfolio snapshot, GET must first try to refresh `portfolio.json` through the existing [ib-sync wrapper](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/lib/tools/wrappers/ib-sync.ts).
- Added ET-session targeting to [performanceFreshness.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/performanceFreshness.ts) with `latestPortfolioTargetDateET()` and `isPortfolioBehindCurrentEtSession()`. The target uses the latest ET weekday, which keeps weekend checks pinned to Friday instead of treating Saturday/Sunday as fresh portfolio sessions.
- Fixed [route.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/api/performance/route.ts) so GET now calls `ibSync({ sync: true, port: 4001 })` when `portfolio.json` is behind the current ET session. If that refresh succeeds, the route rebuilds performance from the fresher portfolio snapshot. If it fails and the cached performance is only as fresh as the stale portfolio snapshot, the route returns the cached performance payload instead of rewriting `performance.json` from stale inputs. If the cached performance already lags a newer `portfolio.json`, the route still rebuilds from that newer on-disk portfolio snapshot.
- Locked the route contract with [performance-route.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/performance-route.test.ts) and expanded [performance-freshness.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/performance-freshness.test.ts) for the ET target-date helpers.
- Verification was green with `npx vitest run web/tests/performance-route.test.ts web/tests/performance-freshness.test.ts` and `cd web && npm run build`.

## Session: Keep /performance Reconstructed YTD In Sync With Portfolio Refreshes (2026-03-13)

### Goal
Stop the `/performance` hero from staying on a stale reconstructed YTD snapshot after the workspace portfolio sync advances. When the shell refreshes `portfolio.last_sync`, the performance panel should promptly revalidate `/api/performance` and adopt the rebuilt same-session payload instead of waiting for its long polling interval or a manual page reload.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Trace the `/performance` freshness contract across the shell portfolio sync, the performance hook, and `/api/performance` so the stale boundary is explicit before editing code) depends_on: []
- T2 (Add failing regression coverage for the stale-after-portfolio-sync behavior in unit and browser tests) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Implement the minimal freshness fix so the performance panel reacts to a newer portfolio sync timestamp and revalidates `/api/performance`) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, review the live `/performance` result, and capture notes) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Trace the `/performance` freshness contract across the shell portfolio sync, the performance hook, and `/api/performance` so the stale boundary is explicit before editing code
- [x] T2 Add failing regression coverage for the stale-after-portfolio-sync behavior in unit and browser tests
- [x] T3 Implement the minimal freshness fix so the performance panel reacts to a newer portfolio sync timestamp and revalidates `/api/performance`
- [x] T4 Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, review the live `/performance` result, and capture notes

### Review
- Root cause: the performance cache route already knew how to rebuild when `data/performance.json` lagged `data/portfolio.json`, but the `/performance` page itself had no link to the shell’s much fresher portfolio sync lifecycle. [usePortfolio.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/usePortfolio.ts) keeps pushing `POST /api/portfolio` updates every 30 seconds and on manual `Sync Now`, while [usePerformance.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/usePerformance.ts) only revalidated `/api/performance` on initial load and every 15 minutes. That left the hero stuck on an older `as_of`/ending-equity snapshot even after the shell had already advanced `portfolio.last_sync`.
- Added a shared freshness contract in [performanceFreshness.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/performanceFreshness.ts). Both [route.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/api/performance/route.ts) and [PerformancePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/PerformancePanel.tsx) now use the same rule: performance is behind whenever either `last_sync` or the session `as_of` date no longer matches the latest portfolio sync timestamp.
- Fixed the UI handoff by threading `portfolioLastSync` from [WorkspaceShell.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/WorkspaceShell.tsx) through [WorkspaceSections.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/WorkspaceSections.tsx) into [PerformancePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/PerformancePanel.tsx). When the shell portfolio sync advances, the performance panel now issues a fresh `GET /api/performance`, which lets the route rebuild inline and replace the stale reconstructed YTD banner immediately instead of waiting for the next long poll.
- Locked the fix with red/green coverage in [performance-freshness.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/performance-freshness.test.ts) and [performance-page.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/performance-page.spec.ts). The new browser regression proves the bug directly: after `Sync Now` advances the portfolio snapshot, the hero updates from `AS OF 2026-03-12` to `AS OF 2026-03-13` and adopts the rebuilt ending equity.
- Verification was green with `npx vitest run web/tests/performance-freshness.test.ts web/tests/performance-route.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/performance-page.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`, and `cd web && npm run build`.

## Session: Keep /regime Aligned With Today's Settled Close After Market Hours (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Stop the `/regime` page from getting stuck on an earlier after-close CRI snapshot. Once the market closes, the open page should keep following `/api/regime` at the route's freshness cadence and roll to today's settled closing values automatically instead of freezing on a stale browser-triggered rescan.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Trace the `/regime` refresh path from `useRegime` through `/api/regime`, confirm why an open page can keep an earlier after-close payload, and record the exact cache-following contract before editing code) depends_on: []
- T2 (Add failing regression coverage for the `/regime` hook config and browser refresh behavior proving the page must adopt newer same-day closed values without browser-side POST rescans) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Update the `/regime` sync configuration so it follows the route freshness contract and keeps the open page aligned with later close-cache updates) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, inspect the post-close `/regime` behavior, and capture review notes in the task log) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Trace the `/regime` refresh path from `useRegime` through `/api/regime`, confirm why an open page can keep an earlier after-close payload, and record the exact cache-following contract before editing code
- [x] T2 Add failing regression coverage for the `/regime` hook config and browser refresh behavior proving the page must adopt newer same-day closed values without browser-side POST rescans
- [x] T3 Update the `/regime` sync configuration so it follows the route freshness contract and keeps the open page aligned with later close-cache updates
- [x] T4 Run targeted verification, inspect the post-close `/regime` behavior, and capture review notes in the task log

### Review
- Root cause: the first post-close CRI scans can still write the prior session for a short window after the bell. On disk, `data/cri_scheduled/cri-2026-03-12T16-01.json` and `...16-02.json` both carried `date: "2026-03-11"`, while a later scan produced `date: "2026-03-12"`. That left two gaps: the scanner could lag the settled close, and an already-open `/regime` page did not revalidate aggressively enough to pick up the corrected payload.
- Fixed the scanner path in [cri_scan.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/cri_scan.py) by synthesizing today's post-close snapshot from current VIX, VVIX, SPY, and COR1M quotes when the daily bar set still ends on the prior session. The targeted regression is [test_cri_scan.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py).
- Fixed the UI follow-through in [useRegime.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/useRegime.ts) by making the regime view cache-following only (`interval: 60_000`, `hasPost: false`) and by adding an ET-session mismatch retry policy. [useSyncHook.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/useSyncHook.ts) now supports optional `shouldRetry`, `retryIntervalMs`, and `retryMethod` so `/regime` can keep doing lightweight `GET` revalidation every 5 seconds until the current-session close arrives.
- Added red/green coverage in [regime-sync-config.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-sync-config.test.ts), [regime-close-transition-retry.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-close-transition-retry.test.ts), [regime-close-transition-refresh.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-close-transition-refresh.spec.ts), and [regime-market-closed-eod.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-market-closed-eod.spec.ts). The browser harnesses prove both behaviors: the page auto-refreshes from a stale prior-session payload to today's close, and the market-closed strip renders the current session close payload once it exists.
- Verification was green with `python3 -m pytest scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py -k AppendPostCloseSnapshot`, `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-close-transition-retry.test.ts web/tests/regime-sync-config.test.ts web/tests/regime-market-closed-values.test.ts web/tests/regime-cri-staleness.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-close-transition-refresh.spec.ts e2e/regime-market-closed-eod.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`, and `cd web && npm run build`.

## Session: Align Regime Quadrant Marker Color With The Classified State (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Fix the `/regime` relationship view so the latest RVOL/COR1M scatter marker uses the same quadrant classification as the summary label and state key. A `Systemic Panic` classification must not render as the yellow `Stock Picker's Market` marker.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the shared regime classification path and record the renderer mismatch before editing tests or UI code) depends_on: []
- T2 (Add failing regression coverage proving the latest quadrant marker must use the classified quadrant color instead of a hardcoded yellow highlight) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Update the relationship-view renderer to derive the latest marker color from the shared quadrant classification) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then capture review notes in the task log) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the shared regime classification path and record the renderer mismatch before editing tests or UI code
- [x] T2 Add failing regression coverage proving the latest quadrant marker must use the classified quadrant color instead of a hardcoded yellow highlight
- [x] T3 Update the relationship-view renderer to derive the latest marker color from the shared quadrant classification
- [x] T4 Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then capture review notes in the task log

### Review
- The root cause was in [web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx): the summary label and state key already used the shared classifier from [web/lib/regimeRelationships.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/regimeRelationships.ts), but the latest scatter marker was still hardcoded to `var(--warning)`, which visually implied `Stock Picker's Market` even when the classifier said otherwise.
- Added a red-phase source contract in [web/tests/regime-relationship-tooltips.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-relationship-tooltips.test.ts) and a browser regression in [web/e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts) to require the latest marker tone to match the classified quadrant.
- Fixed the renderer by deriving `latestQuadrantColor` from `quadrantTone(latest.quadrant)` and using that for the latest scatter point fill and stroke in [web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx).
- Verification was green with `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-relationship-tooltips.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts --grep "classified quadrant tone"`. The Playwright check initially hit a stale long-lived `next-server` on port `3000`; after replacing that server with a fresh Playwright-managed Next instance, the browser test passed against the patched code.

## Session: Append Local Timezone To Rendered Web Timestamps (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Audit `/web` for every rendered timestamp or clock string and make those UI surfaces include the machine-local timezone abbreviation. The implementation must use the actual local timezone dynamically instead of hardcoding `PST`, because the abbreviation changes with daylight saving time.

- T4 (Run targeted verification, review the rendered timestamp strings, and capture review notes in the task log) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [ ] T1 Audit `/web` for all rendered timestamps and record the exact surface list before editing code
- [ ] T2 Design or identify a shared formatter that appends the local timezone abbreviation dynamically

## Session: Split Remaining Runtime Artifacts And Prior Feature Work Into Scoped Commits (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Take the remaining listed worktree items and turn them into clean individual commits without pulling in unrelated files. The expected batches are runtime/cache artifacts, the stale frozen option `LAST` feature from the prior session, and the one-line brand guidance update if it stands alone.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the listed dirty and untracked files, confirm the logical groupings, and record the exact commit plan before staging anything) depends_on: []
- T2 (Validate the stale frozen option `LAST` feature bundle and decide whether the untracked Playwright config belongs with it) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Create separate scoped commits for runtime artifacts, stale frozen option `LAST` logic/tests, and the docs guidance change) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Verify the resulting commit stack and capture review notes in the task log) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the listed dirty and untracked files, confirm the logical groupings, and record the exact commit plan before staging anything
- [x] T2 Validate the stale frozen option `LAST` feature bundle and decide whether the untracked Playwright config belongs with it

- Created `f63843a` (`chore: refresh runtime cache artifacts`) for the safe runtime outputs only: [AAOI.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/data/company_info_cache/AAOI.json), [PLTR.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/data/company_info_cache/PLTR.json), [cta-sync.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/data/service_health/cta-sync.json), [option_close_cache.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/data/option_close_cache.json), and [.claude/hooks/dead-code.manifest](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/.claude/hooks/dead-code.manifest).
- Created `2a485d6` (`fix: guard option last price against stale frozen ticks`) for the prior-session option price feature: [ib_tick_handler.js](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/ib_tick_handler.js), [stale-frozen-last.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/stale-frozen-last.test.ts), and [stale-option-last-price.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/stale-option-last-price.spec.ts). Verification was green with `npx vitest run web/tests/stale-frozen-last.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/stale-option-last-price.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`. The only code adjustment during validation was fixing the Playwright selector to target the option last-price cell instead of the underlying placeholder cell.
- Created `a7ad62e` (`docs: add dense telemetry strip guidance`) for the one-line guidance note in [brand-identity.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/docs/brand-identity.md).
- Left [playwright.strip.config.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/playwright.strip.config.ts) out of the commit stack because it targets only `regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts` and is unrelated to the stale frozen option `LAST` feature or the runtime artifact/doc batches.

## Session: Remove Generic IB Reconnect Banner Regression (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Limit the shell-level IB connection banner to the actionable MFA/IBC approval state only. Generic reconnect and disconnect states should not render the upper banner again; those belong on the existing toast channel. This specifically fixes the regression where `IB Gateway reconnected` is shown as a full-width top banner.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the current banner contract, record the regression scope, and capture the user-correction lesson before editing tests or UI code) depends_on: []
- T2 (Add failing unit and Playwright coverage proving that generic reconnect status must not render the upper banner while MFA approval still does) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Tighten the connection-banner helper and renderer so only the actionable MFA state surfaces in the upper shell banner) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted Vitest, Playwright, and build verification, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current banner contract, record the regression scope, and capture the user-correction lesson before editing tests or UI code
- [x] T2 Add failing unit and Playwright coverage proving that generic reconnect status must not render the upper banner while MFA approval still does
- [x] T3 Tighten the connection-banner helper and renderer so only the actionable MFA state surfaces in the upper shell banner
- [x] T4 Run targeted Vitest, Playwright, and build verification, then capture review notes

### Review
- Root cause: the earlier MFA fix expanded [ibConnectionAlert.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/ibConnectionAlert.ts) and [ConnectionBanner.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/ConnectionBanner.tsx) into a generic shell-level connection banner. That reintroduced the top-of-shell `IB Gateway reconnected` / `IB Gateway disconnected` strip, which should have remained on the existing toast channel only.
- Tightened the banner contract so the upper shell banner now renders only for the actionable `ibc_mfa_required` state. Generic websocket disconnects, generic IB disconnects, and reconnect success states now return `null` from [ibConnectionAlert.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/ibConnectionAlert.ts), and [ConnectionBanner.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/ConnectionBanner.tsx) is now a stateless MFA-warning renderer instead of a reconnect/disconnect state machine.
- Locked the regression with unit coverage in [connection-banner-state.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/connection-banner-state.test.ts) and browser coverage in [ib-mfa-reconnect-alert.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/ib-mfa-reconnect-alert.spec.ts). The browser file now proves three cases: MFA warning does show the upper banner, generic disconnect does not, and generic reconnect success does not.
- Verified green with `npx vitest run web/tests/connection-banner-state.test.ts web/tests/ib-connection-issue.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/ib-mfa-reconnect-alert.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`, and `cd web && npm run build`.

## Session: Surface IB Gateway MFA Approval In The UI (2026-03-12)

### Goal
When the repo-owned realtime server starts while IB Gateway is still reconnecting behind IBC and emits `IB error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:4001`, surface an explicit operator-facing UI alert that tells the user to check the Interactive Brokers push notification on their phone and approve MFA instead of leaving the cause buried in terminal logs.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the current realtime status flow and record the MFA-alert contract before editing code) depends_on: []
- T2 (Add failing regression tests for the server-side IB-issue classification and the UI alert-copy contract) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Implement the server status reason, client-side status plumbing, and the visible UI alert/toast behavior) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current realtime status flow and record the MFA-alert contract before editing code
- [x] T2 Add failing regression tests for the server-side IB-issue classification and the UI alert-copy contract
- [x] T3 Implement the server status reason, client-side status plumbing, and the visible UI alert/toast behavior
- [x] T4 Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then capture review notes

### Review
- Root cause: [scripts/ib_realtime_server.js](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/ib_realtime_server.js) only surfaced the IB Gateway reconnect failure as a terminal log (`IB error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:4001`). The websocket status payload sent to the browser only carried `ib_connected`, so the UI could not distinguish "gateway disconnected" from "IBC is waiting on phone MFA approval."
- Added a server-side classifier in [ib_connection_status.js](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/ib_connection_status.js) and wired it into [ib_realtime_server.js](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/ib_realtime_server.js). When the reconnect error matches the local gateway refusal, the websocket status now includes `ib_issue: "ibc_mfa_required"` plus an operator-facing `ib_status_message` telling the user to check the Interactive Brokers push notification on their phone and approve MFA.
- Extended the browser protocol and client plumbing in [pricesProtocol.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/pricesProtocol.ts), [usePrices.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/usePrices.ts), [ibConnectionAlert.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/ibConnectionAlert.ts), [ConnectionBanner.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/ConnectionBanner.tsx), and [WorkspaceShell.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/WorkspaceShell.tsx). The shell now renders a visible warning banner and uses MFA-specific disconnect toast copy instead of a generic lost-connection message.
- Locked the fix with targeted regression coverage in [ib-connection-issue.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/ib-connection-issue.test.ts), [connection-banner-state.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/connection-banner-state.test.ts), and [ib-mfa-reconnect-alert.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/ib-mfa-reconnect-alert.spec.ts). Verified green with `npx vitest run web/tests/ib-connection-issue.test.ts web/tests/connection-banner-state.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/ib-mfa-reconnect-alert.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`, and `cd web && npm run build`.

## Session: Make IB Realtime Dev Startup Survive Port 8765 Conflicts (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Fix the `web` verbose dev workflow so `node ../scripts/ib_realtime_server.js` does not crash the whole startup path when websocket port `8765` is already occupied. The dev server should handle a reusable existing listener or a collision gracefully instead of throwing an unhandled `EADDRINUSE`.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Record the port-conflict bug contract and the latest user-correction lesson before editing tests or startup code) depends_on: []
- T2 (Inspect the verbose dev startup path and add a failing regression test that reproduces the current `EADDRINUSE` crash) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Implement the minimal IB realtime server startup fix so the dev workflow handles an occupied port cleanly) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted regression and startup verification, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Record the port-conflict bug contract and the latest user-correction lesson before editing tests or startup code
- [x] T2 Inspect the verbose dev startup path and add a failing regression test that reproduces the current `EADDRINUSE` crash
- [x] T3 Implement the minimal IB realtime server startup fix so the dev workflow handles an occupied port cleanly
- [x] T4 Run targeted regression and startup verification, then capture review notes

### Review
- Root cause: [scripts/ib_realtime_server.js](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/ib_realtime_server.js) created the `WebSocketServer` at module load. If `8765` was already occupied, Node emitted an uncaught `EADDRINUSE` before the dev workflow could recover, which is exactly the crash shown in your `dev:verbose:next` output.
- Fixed startup by probing the websocket port before creating the server in [scripts/ib_realtime_server.js](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/ib_realtime_server.js). When the port is already bound, the script now prints an explicit reuse message and exits `0` instead of throwing.
- Added a real regression in [ib-realtime-port-conflict.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/ib-realtime-port-conflict.test.ts) that occupies an ephemeral TCP port, spawns the realtime server against it, and asserts a clean exit plus the reuse message.
- Verified green with `npx vitest run web/tests/ib-realtime-port-conflict.test.ts` and `cd web && node ../scripts/ib_realtime_server.js`, which now returns:
  `WebSocket port already in use at ws://0.0.0.0:8765; assuming an existing IB realtime server and skipping duplicate startup.`

## Session: Document And Ship Regime Responsive UI Pass (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Capture the `/regime` strip and relationship-view learnings in the repo docs, then create a scoped commit and push only the relevant UI, test, and documentation changes without pulling unrelated dirty files into the batch.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the current worktree and identify the operator-facing docs that should record the `/regime` responsive learnings) depends_on: []
- T2 (Update the selected docs plus the task log with the final `/regime` responsive-strip and relationship-view learnings) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Stage only the relevant `/regime` UI, tests, task-log, and documentation files, then create a scoped commit) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Push the commit, verify the pushed state, and capture the exact ship summary in the task log) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current worktree and identify the operator-facing docs that should record the `/regime` responsive learnings
- [x] T2 Update the selected docs plus the task log with the final `/regime` responsive-strip and relationship-view learnings
- [x] T3 Stage only the relevant `/regime` UI, tests, task-log, and documentation files, then create a scoped commit
- [x] T4 Push the commit, verify the pushed state, and capture the exact ship summary in the task log

### Review
- Updated the operator-facing summary in [README.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/README.md) so the terminal docs now describe the shared `/regime` strip renderer and its responsive `5-up -> 3x2 -> stacked telemetry rail` contract.
- Added a ship note in [docs/status.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/docs/status.md) that captures the full `/regime` batch: shared strip renderer, earlier narrow-width detail-panel collapse, and actionable plus hoverable normalized-divergence guidance.
- Created the scoped ship commit `13aadeb` (`fix: tighten regime operator telemetry`) from only the `/regime` UI, tests, docs, and task-log files, leaving unrelated runtime/cache/worktree files out of the batch.
- Verified the shipped batch with `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts web/tests/regime-detail-panels-responsive.test.ts web/tests/regime-relationship-tooltips.test.ts`, `cd web && npm run build`, and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts e2e/regime-detail-panels-responsive.spec.ts e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`.

## Session: Replace Centered Mobile Strip Rows With Anchored Telemetry Rails (2026-03-12)

### Goal
When the `/regime` strip collapses to a single-column stack, stop centering the telemetry cluster inside each row. Use the full row width with an anchored compact rail: keep the instrument label and value as the left-side primary signal, keep the change arrow attached to the change text, and pack the supporting context into a horizontal meta rail instead of wasting half the viewport as empty panel space.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Record the corrected anchored-row contract and the latest user-correction lesson before editing tests or UI code) depends_on: []
- T2 (Update unit and Playwright strip coverage to require the anchored telemetry-rail layout in the stacked mobile state and observe the red state) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Refactor the stacked strip markup/CSS to a left-anchored telemetry rail without regressing the desktop and mid-width strip presentations) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, inspect the live `/regime` result, and capture review notes) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Record the corrected anchored-row contract and the latest user-correction lesson before editing tests or UI code
- [x] T2 Update unit and Playwright strip coverage to require the anchored telemetry-rail layout in the stacked mobile state and observe the red state
- [x] T3 Refactor the stacked strip markup/CSS to a left-anchored telemetry rail without regressing the desktop and mid-width strip presentations
- [x] T4 Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, inspect the live `/regime` result, and capture review notes

### Review
- Moved the stacked-strip renderer to an intentional two-column mobile rail in [web/components/RegimeStrip.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimeStrip.tsx): each row now has a compact primary column for label plus value and a shared `regime-strip-meta-row` for delta, context, and timestamp instead of dumping every token into one centered cluster.
- Refined the small-screen strip rules in [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) so `760px` and below use a `minmax(96px, 112px) / 1fr` grid plus a bordered meta rail with segmented dividers. That turns the wasted panel space into a deliberate telemetry tape while keeping the delta arrow attached to the change text.
- Locked the source contract in [web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts) and updated the Playwright strip harness in [web/e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts) so it validates the shared `RegimeStrip` renderer in the browser. The red phase failed first on the missing `regime-strip-primary`/`regime-strip-meta-row` structure and the missing mobile grid contract.
- Verified green with `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`.

## Session: Compress Stacked Mobile Strip Cells Into Single-Line Rows (2026-03-12)

### Goal
When the `/regime` strip is in its single-column stacked state, use the full row width by centering the telemetry content vertically and laying the cell metadata out in one horizontal line instead of a tall vertical stack.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Record the corrected stacked-row compactness contract and the user-correction lesson before editing tests or CSS) depends_on: []
- T2 (Update unit and Playwright strip coverage to require a centered single-line cell layout in the stacked mobile state and observe the red state) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Refine the small-screen strip layout/CSS so each stacked cell uses a compact horizontal row presentation without regressing the mid-width strip states) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted strip verification and capture review notes before resuming any additional browser validation) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Record the corrected stacked-row compactness contract and the user-correction lesson before editing tests or CSS
- [x] T2 Update unit and Playwright strip coverage to require a centered single-line cell layout in the stacked mobile state and observe the red state
- [x] T3 Refine the small-screen strip layout/CSS so each stacked cell uses a compact horizontal row presentation without regressing the mid-width strip states
- [x] T4 Run targeted strip verification and capture review notes before resuming any additional browser validation

### Review
- Refined the stacked-mobile strip presentation in [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) so each `regime-strip-cell` becomes a compact centered row at `760px` and below: label, value, delta, context subline, and timestamp now sit on one horizontal line instead of stacking vertically.
- Tightened the supporting small-screen rules so the delta row remains inline and the surrounding telemetry tokens stop wrapping vertically in the collapsed state.
- Locked the contract in [web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts) and [web/e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts). The red phase failed because the stacked strip still kept the desktop column layout inside each cell.
- Verified green with `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`.

## Session: Left Align Mobile Strip Delta Rows (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Keep the small-screen `/regime` strip vertically stacked, but make the delta rows inside each cell stay left aligned and inline so the arrow stays attached to the change text instead of drifting to the far right edge.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Record the corrected mobile delta-row contract and the user-correction lesson before editing tests or CSS) depends_on: []
- T2 (Update unit and Playwright strip coverage to require inline, left-aligned delta rows in the stacked mobile strip and observe the red state) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Refine the small-screen strip CSS so delta rows use an inline left-aligned layout without disturbing the mid-width strip geometry) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted strip verification and capture review notes before resuming the rebuild/restart flow) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Record the corrected mobile delta-row contract and the user-correction lesson before editing tests or CSS
- [x] T2 Update unit and Playwright strip coverage to require inline, left-aligned delta rows in the stacked mobile strip and observe the red state
- [x] T3 Refine the small-screen strip CSS so delta rows use an inline left-aligned layout without disturbing the mid-width strip geometry
- [x] T4 Run targeted strip verification and capture review notes before resuming the rebuild/restart flow

### Review
- Refined the stacked-mobile strip behavior in [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) so `.regime-strip-day-chg` switches from the desktop `minmax(0, 1fr) auto` split to an inline left-aligned flex row at `760px` and below. The arrow now stays attached to the change text inside each vertically stacked cell instead of drifting to the far right edge.
- Locked that contract in [web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts) and [web/e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts). The red phase failed because the small-screen strip still used the desktop split layout.
- Verified green with `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`.

## Session: Make Mid-Width Regime Strip Bottom Row Symmetric (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Keep the `/regime` strip on a clean mid-width `3 x 2` presentation without an empty slot and without an asymmetrical bottom row, so the two second-row cards render at equal width before the strip collapses vertically on small screens.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Record the corrected symmetric-bottom-row contract and the user-correction lesson before editing tests or CSS) depends_on: []
- T2 (Update unit and Playwright strip coverage to require two equal-width bottom-row cards in the mid-width state and observe the red state) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Refine the mid-width strip grid so the first row stays three-up while the second row renders two equal-width cards, then preserve the small-screen vertical collapse) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted strip verification and capture review notes before resuming the rebuild/restart flow) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Record the corrected symmetric-bottom-row contract and the user-correction lesson before editing tests or CSS
- [x] T2 Update unit and Playwright strip coverage to require two equal-width bottom-row cards in the mid-width state and observe the red state
- [x] T3 Refine the mid-width strip grid so the first row stays three-up while the second row renders two equal-width cards, then preserve the small-screen vertical collapse
- [x] T4 Run targeted strip verification and capture review notes before resuming the rebuild/restart flow

### Review
- Reworked the mid-width strip geometry in [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) to a six-track internal grid at `1180px` and below: the first three cards span two tracks each, and the bottom two cards span three tracks each. That preserves the visual `3 x 2` presentation while making the bottom row symmetric.
- Updated [web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts) and [web/e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts) to require equal-width bottom-row cards in the mid-width state. The red phase failed because the previous fix still stretched `COR1M` while leaving `RVOL` narrow.
- Verified green with `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`.

## Session: Rebuild And Restart Radon Web For Browser Validation (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Rebuild the Radon web app, restart the repo-owned web server cleanly on the standard local port, confirm it responds, and open `/regime` in the browser for direct inspection.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the current web scripts and running Radon web processes so the correct server can be rebuilt and restarted) depends_on: []
- T2 (Run a fresh production build for `web` and address any build blocker that prevents restart) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Stop the repo-owned Radon web/IB dev stack, restart it cleanly, and confirm the target local URL responds) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Open the validated `/regime` URL in the browser and capture the execution result in the task log) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current web scripts and running Radon web processes so the correct server can be rebuilt and restarted
- [x] T2 Run a fresh production build for `web` and address any build blocker that prevents restart
- [x] T3 Stop the repo-owned Radon web/IB dev stack, restart it cleanly, and confirm the target local URL responds
- [x] T4 Open the validated `/regime` URL in the browser and capture the execution result in the task log

### Review
- Rebuilt the current `web` worktree successfully with `cd web && npm run build`. The only blocker was a pre-existing TypeScript union-access issue in [web/components/CtaPage.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/CtaPage.tsx), which is now fixed by explicitly separating `sync_health` and `sync_status` fallback access instead of reading mixed properties off the union.
- Stopped the repo-owned `localhost:3000` Radon dev stack and its paired IB websocket process, then restarted it from [web/package.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/package.json) with `npm run dev`. The stack came back cleanly: Next.js reported `Local: http://localhost:3000` and the IB realtime server reported `listening on ws://0.0.0.0:8765` plus `IB connected`.
- Confirmed the rebuilt server is serving the target page with `curl -I http://localhost:3000/regime`, which returned `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`, and opened `http://localhost:3000/regime` in the browser with `open http://localhost:3000/regime`.

## Session: Remove Empty Regime Strip Placeholder At Mid Widths (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Keep the `/regime` telemetry strip on a clean `3 x 2` layout at mid-width desktop/tablet sizes without rendering an empty placeholder cell, then collapse to a fully vertical stack on small viewports.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Record the corrected odd-card strip contract and the user-correction lesson before editing tests or CSS) depends_on: []
- T2 (Update unit and Playwright coverage to require a filled `3 x 2` strip with no empty placeholder and a vertical small-screen collapse, then observe the red state) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Implement the minimal grid/CSS change so the fifth card fills the last row cleanly and the strip stacks to one column on small viewports) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification and capture review notes) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Record the corrected odd-card strip contract and the user-correction lesson before editing tests or CSS
- [x] T2 Update unit and Playwright coverage to require a filled `3 x 2` strip with no empty placeholder and a vertical small-screen collapse, then observe the red state
- [x] T3 Implement the minimal grid/CSS change so the fifth card fills the last row cleanly and the strip stacks to one column on small viewports
- [x] T4 Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification and capture review notes

### Review
- Root cause: [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) collapsed the five-card strip to `repeat(3, minmax(0, 1fr))` at `1180px` and below while leaving the grid container background visible. With only five cards, that produced an unused sixth grid slot that read like a fake empty card.
- Fixed the mid-width collapse in [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) by making the last strip cell span the remaining two columns in the `3 x 2` state, then resetting that span and switching to a true `1fr` stack at `760px` and below so smaller screens collapse vertically instead of to a sparse multi-column layout.
- Locked the new contract in [web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts) and [web/e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts). The red phase failed because the old CSS had no last-card span rule and still used a smaller-screen multi-column collapse.
- Verified green with `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts web/tests/regime-relationship-tooltips.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`.

## Session: Make Normalized Divergence Tooltip Actionable And Hoverable (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Update the `/regime` `NORMALIZED DIVERGENCE` surface so the tooltip explains the concrete trade and portfolio actions implied by the RVOL versus COR1M relationship, and the chart itself exposes hoverable point-in-time readouts like the analytical time-series charts.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Record the corrected tooltip-plus-hover goal and the user-correction lessons before editing tests or code) depends_on: []
- T2 (Update unit and Playwright coverage to require actionable normalized-divergence guidance plus a hoverable z-score chart and observe the red state) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Revise the centralized tooltip copy and implement the z-score chart hover overlay using the shared analytical-chart interaction pattern) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification and capture review notes) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Record the corrected tooltip-plus-hover goal and the user-correction lessons before editing tests or code
- [x] T2 Update unit and Playwright coverage to require actionable normalized-divergence guidance plus a hoverable z-score chart and observe the red state
- [x] T3 Revise the centralized tooltip copy and implement the z-score chart hover overlay using the shared analytical-chart interaction pattern
- [x] T4 Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification and capture review notes

### Review
- Centralized the actionable `NORMALIZED DIVERGENCE` guidance in [web/lib/sectionTooltips.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/sectionTooltips.ts) so the tooltip now explains both sides of the signal in portfolio terms: positive-gap posture (`reduce gross exposure`, `keep or add index hedges`) and negative-gap posture (`harvest crash hedges`, rotate back toward `single-name` expression when the gap mean-reverts).
- Added chart hover telemetry to [web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx) with a dedicated chart shell, SVG overlay hook, hover state, and a shared `.chart-tooltip` readout for date, `RVOL z-score`, `COR1M z-score`, and `Divergence`, while keeping the rest of the relationship view static.
- Added the minimal supporting styles in [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) and locked the surface contract in [web/tests/regime-relationship-tooltips.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-relationship-tooltips.test.ts) plus [web/e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts). The red phase failed because the tooltip copy was still definition-only and the z-score chart had no hover DOM or readout.
- Verified green with `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts web/tests/regime-relationship-tooltips.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`.

## Session: Fix Regime Detail Panels Collapse On Narrower Viewports (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Make the `/regime` `CRI COMPONENTS` and `CRASH TRIGGER CONDITIONS` panels collapse cleanly on narrower viewports instead of staying in a cramped two-column row, and add the missing `NORMALIZED DIVERGENCE` info bubble in the relationship section.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the shared detail-panel row and record the responsive-fix plan plus correction lesson before changing code) depends_on: []
- T2 (Add failing unit and Playwright coverage that requires the two panels to stack cleanly at narrower widths and exposes the missing `NORMALIZED DIVERGENCE` tooltip) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Implement the responsive detail-panel grid, any minimal internal spacing adjustments needed to avoid clipping, and the tooltip wiring/copy) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification and capture review notes) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the shared detail-panel row and record the responsive-fix plan plus correction lesson before changing code
- [x] T2 Add failing unit and Playwright coverage that requires the two panels to stack cleanly at narrower widths and exposes the missing `NORMALIZED DIVERGENCE` tooltip
- [x] T3 Implement the responsive detail-panel grid, any minimal internal spacing adjustments needed to avoid clipping, and the tooltip wiring/copy
- [x] T4 Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification and capture review notes

### Review
- Replaced the inline `1fr 1fr` split in [web/components/RegimePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimePanel.tsx) with a shared `.regime-detail-grid` in [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css). The row now stays two-up on wide screens and stacks to one column at `980px` and below, with small-screen adjustments for component bars and trigger rows so the full-width stacked panels do not clip internal labels or values.
- Added the missing `NORMALIZED DIVERGENCE` tooltip in [web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx) and centralized its copy in [web/lib/sectionTooltips.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/sectionTooltips.ts), using explicit trigger and bubble test IDs so the operator-facing info surface is covered by browser tests.
- The red phase failed in [web/tests/regime-detail-panels-responsive.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-detail-panels-responsive.test.ts), [web/tests/regime-relationship-tooltips.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-relationship-tooltips.test.ts), [web/e2e/regime-detail-panels-responsive.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-detail-panels-responsive.spec.ts), and [web/e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts) because the detail row was still permanently side by side and the z-score panel had no tooltip trigger or copy key.
- Verified green with `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts web/tests/regime-detail-panels-responsive.test.ts web/tests/regime-cor1m-live.test.ts web/tests/regime-relationship-tooltips.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts e2e/regime-detail-panels-responsive.spec.ts e2e/regime-cor1m.spec.ts e2e/regime-live-index-stream.spec.ts e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`.

## Session: Replace One-Row Regime Strip Compression With Balanced Collapse (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Fix the `/regime` strip so narrower widths do not clip cards and do not force an awkward one-row squeeze; use `RVOL` in the compressed state and collapse into a balanced multi-row grid before the cards become unreadable.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Record the revised strip-responsive contract and correction lesson before changing tests or CSS again) depends_on: []
- T2 (Update unit and Playwright coverage to expect a balanced multi-row collapse and observe the red state) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Implement the revised breakpoint/layout strategy in the shared regime strip markup and CSS) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Record the revised strip-responsive contract and correction lesson before changing tests or CSS again
- [x] T2 Update unit and Playwright coverage to expect a balanced multi-row collapse and observe the red state
- [x] T3 Implement the revised breakpoint/layout strategy in the shared regime strip markup and CSS
- [x] T4 Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then capture review notes

### Review
- Replaced the failed one-row compression strategy with a tiered strip layout in [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css): the strip stays five-up at full width, collapses to three columns at `1180px` and below, then two columns at `760px` and below, with a one-column fallback at `520px`. The `RVOL` abbreviation remains active in the compressed states.
- Kept the semantic label swap in [web/components/RegimePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimePanel.tsx) so `REALIZED VOL` becomes `RVOL` when the strip is compacted, but stopped relying on abbreviation alone to save the layout.
- Locked the corrected contract in [web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts) and [web/e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts). The red phase failed because the previous CSS only had the one-row compressed strip and no explicit `3 / 2` collapse tiers.
- Verified green with `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts web/tests/regime-cor1m-live.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts e2e/regime-cor1m.spec.ts e2e/regime-live-index-stream.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`.

## Session: Replace Regime Strip Wrap With RVOL Abbreviation (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Refine the `/regime` strip responsive behavior so narrower desktop widths keep the five-card row intact by abbreviating `REALIZED VOL` to `RVOL`, while preserving a true wrap fallback only for genuinely small viewports.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Record the corrected responsive contract and capture the user-correction lesson before changing the strip again) depends_on: []
- T2 (Update unit and Playwright coverage to expect an `RVOL` abbreviation at narrower widths and observe the red state) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Implement the label-abbreviation and breakpoint refinement in the shared strip markup/CSS) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Record the corrected responsive contract and capture the user-correction lesson before changing the strip again
- [x] T2 Update unit and Playwright coverage to expect an `RVOL` abbreviation at narrower widths and observe the red state
- [x] T3 Implement the label-abbreviation and breakpoint refinement in the shared strip markup/CSS
- [x] T4 Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then capture review notes

### Review
- Replaced the previous wrap-first responsive behavior with a narrower-desktop compaction strategy: [web/components/RegimePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimePanel.tsx) now provides both `REALIZED VOL` and `RVOL` label tokens for the strip, and [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) keeps the strip as a five-column grid by default, abbreviates that label at `1180px` and below, tightens spacing/type slightly, and only falls back to the wrapped auto-fit grid at `860px` and below.
- The corrected red phase is locked in [web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts) and [web/e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts): before the patch, unit tests failed because the strip was still auto-fit at all widths and the `RVOL` abbreviation did not exist, and Playwright failed because the narrower-desktop strip still rendered `REALIZED VOL`.
- Verified green with `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts web/tests/regime-cor1m-live.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts e2e/regime-cor1m.spec.ts e2e/regime-live-index-stream.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`.

## Session: Fix Regime Strip Card Collapse On Narrower Viewports (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Prevent the `/regime` live-strip cards from overlapping on narrower desktop/tablet widths by introducing a cleaner responsive collapse pattern for the five telemetry cards.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the current `/regime` strip layout and record the responsive-fix plan in `tasks/todo.md` plus the correction lesson in `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: []
- T2 (Add failing unit and Playwright coverage that reproduces the strip overlap risk at a narrower viewport) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Implement the smallest clean collapse strategy in the shared strip markup/CSS without regressing the existing desktop layout) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current `/regime` strip layout and record the responsive-fix plan in `tasks/todo.md` plus the correction lesson in `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T2 Add failing unit and Playwright coverage that reproduces the strip overlap risk at a narrower viewport
- [x] T3 Implement the smallest clean collapse strategy in the shared strip markup/CSS without regressing the existing desktop layout
- [x] T4 Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then capture review notes

### Review
- Root cause: [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) forced the regime strip into `repeat(5, 1fr)` while the strip cells had no `min-width: 0`, and the day-change line used `white-space: nowrap`. On narrower desktop widths the strip kept five compressed cards in one row, which is why the `COR1M` card could visually collide with its neighbor instead of collapsing cleanly.
- Added red-phase coverage in [web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts) and [web/e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts). The unit test failed on the old fixed five-column grid and nowrap day-change rule, and the Playwright test failed because the `COR1M` card remained on the same row as `VIX` at a `960px` viewport.
- Fixed the strip by converting it to an auto-fitting grid with a real card minimum width, giving cells an explicit shrink boundary, and letting change/subline text wrap instead of forcing a single unbreakable telemetry row in [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css).
- Verified green with `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-strip-responsive.test.ts web/tests/regime-cor1m-live.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-strip-responsive.spec.ts e2e/regime-cor1m.spec.ts e2e/regime-live-index-stream.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`.

## Session: Document And Ship Quote Telemetry Contract (2026-03-12)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Identify the operator-facing docs and the exact quote-telemetry files that belong in the ship batch) depends_on: []
- T2 (Update the docs to reflect the shared BID/MID/ASK/SPREAD contract and raw spread-dollar plus percent display) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Stage only the quote-telemetry code, tests, docs, and task-log files) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Create a scoped commit for the quote-telemetry refactor and push the current branch) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Identify the operator-facing docs and the exact quote-telemetry files that belong in the ship batch
- [x] T2 Update the docs to reflect the shared BID/MID/ASK/SPREAD contract and raw spread-dollar plus percent display
- [x] T3 Stage only the quote-telemetry code, tests, docs, and task-log files
- [x] T4 Create a scoped commit for the quote-telemetry refactor and push the current branch

### Review
- Updated the operator-facing terminal docs in [README.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/README.md) and [docs/status.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/docs/status.md) so the shared quote ladder contract is documented as `BID`, `MID`, `ASK`, `SPREAD`, with spread rendered as raw quote width plus midpoint percent.
- The ship batch is scoped to the shared quote calculator and renderer in [web/lib/quoteTelemetry.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/quoteTelemetry.ts) and [web/components/QuoteTelemetry.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/QuoteTelemetry.tsx), plus the three consuming surfaces in [web/components/TickerDetailModal.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/TickerDetailModal.tsx), [web/components/InstrumentDetailModal.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/InstrumentDetailModal.tsx), and [web/components/ModifyOrderModal.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/ModifyOrderModal.tsx).
- Locked the contract with focused unit coverage in [web/tests/quote-telemetry-wrappers.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/quote-telemetry-wrappers.test.ts), [web/tests/price-bar-quote-telemetry.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/price-bar-quote-telemetry.test.ts), [web/tests/ticker-detail-spread-notional.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/ticker-detail-spread-notional.test.ts), [web/tests/order-ticket-spread-notional.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/order-ticket-spread-notional.test.ts), and [web/tests/instrument-detail-spread-quantity.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/instrument-detail-spread-quantity.test.ts), plus browser coverage in [web/e2e/price-bar-quote-telemetry.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/price-bar-quote-telemetry.spec.ts), [web/e2e/order-ticket-quote-telemetry.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/order-ticket-quote-telemetry.spec.ts), and [web/e2e/modify-order-spread-telemetry.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/modify-order-spread-telemetry.spec.ts).
- Verified green before shipping with `npx vitest run web/tests/quote-telemetry-wrappers.test.ts web/tests/price-bar-quote-telemetry.test.ts web/tests/ticker-detail-spread-notional.test.ts web/tests/order-ticket-spread-notional.test.ts web/tests/instrument-detail-spread-quantity.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/price-bar-quote-telemetry.spec.ts e2e/order-ticket-quote-telemetry.spec.ts e2e/modify-order-spread-telemetry.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`.

## Session: Prove Regime Live Index Streaming With TDD (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Add red/green unit and browser coverage that proves `/regime` renders live websocket prices for `VIX`, `VVIX`, and `COR1M`.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect existing live-stream coverage and record the implementation plan in `tasks/todo.md`) depends_on: []
- T2 (Add failing unit and Playwright tests that prove `/regime` replaces cached values with live websocket prices for `VIX`, `VVIX`, and `COR1M`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Implement the minimal runtime fix or hardening needed to satisfy the live-stream contract) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification against the running dev server and capture review notes) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect existing live-stream coverage and record the implementation plan in `tasks/todo.md`
- [x] T2 Add failing unit and Playwright tests that prove `/regime` replaces cached values with live websocket prices for `VIX`, `VVIX`, and `COR1M`
- [x] T3 Implement the minimal runtime fix or hardening needed to satisfy the live-stream contract
- [x] T4 Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification against the running dev server and capture review notes

### Review
- Added a red/green server-side regression in [web/tests/ib-index-stream-contracts.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/ib-index-stream-contracts.test.ts) that failed against the old cold-start behavior because [scripts/ib_realtime_server.js](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/ib_realtime_server.js) did not preserve typed stock/option/index contracts before the `ibConnected` gate and rebuilt restored subscriptions as stocks.
- Fixed that by adding `ensureSymbolState()` in [scripts/ib_realtime_server.js](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/ib_realtime_server.js) and seeding stock, option, and index subscriptions with their IB contract as soon as the websocket subscribe message arrives. `restoreSubscriptions()` now reuses the stored contract instead of falling back to `stock()` for everything.
- Added browser regression coverage in [web/e2e/regime-live-index-streaming.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-live-index-streaming.spec.ts) and [web/e2e/regime-live-index-stream.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-live-index-stream.spec.ts). The first proves `/regime` subscribes to `VIX`, `VVIX`, and `COR1M` before emitting live websocket prices; the second proves a batched websocket payload replaces cached CRI values with live strip values and day-change rows for all three indices.
- Added targeted unit coverage in [web/tests/use-previous-close-indexes.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/use-previous-close-indexes.test.ts) and hardened [web/lib/usePreviousClose.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/usePreviousClose.ts) with `shouldBackfillPreviousClose(...)` so the websocket-backed regime indices (`VIX`, `VVIX`, `COR1M`) no longer trigger the stock `/api/previous-close` fallback path.
- Verified green with `npx vitest run web/tests/ib-index-stream-contracts.test.ts web/tests/use-previous-close-indexes.test.ts web/tests/regime-cor1m-live.test.ts web/tests/batched-prices.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-live-index-streaming.spec.ts`, and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-live-index-stream.spec.ts e2e/regime-cor1m-live-stream.spec.ts e2e/regime-vix-live-badge.spec.ts` against the running dev server.
- `cd web && npm run build` still fails on the pre-existing unrelated TypeScript error in [web/components/CtaPage.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/CtaPage.tsx): the `syncStatus` union does not narrow `last_attempt_started_at`.

## Session: Change Spread Display To Raw Dollars And Percent (2026-03-12)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the shared quote telemetry contract and identify every component/test that still assumes notional spread dollars or bps) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the corrected contract in `tasks/todo.md` and capture the new lesson in `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Update unit and Playwright tests to the raw-spread-plus-percent contract and observe the red state) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement the shared calculator change and keep all quote surfaces aligned through the wrappers) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the shared quote telemetry contract and identify every component/test that still assumes notional spread dollars or bps
- [x] T2 Record the corrected contract in `tasks/todo.md` and capture the new lesson in `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Update unit and Playwright tests to the raw-spread-plus-percent contract and observe the red state
- [x] T4 Implement the shared calculator change and keep all quote surfaces aligned through the wrappers
- [x] T5 Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then capture review notes

### Review
- Root cause: the shared quote telemetry refactor still preserved an incorrect spread contract. [web/lib/quoteTelemetry.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/quoteTelemetry.ts) was formatting spread as notional dollars and bps, and the wrappers still carried quantity/multiplier or execution-specific spread policies that made a `3.30 x 3.40` option quote render as `$1,000.00 / 299 bps` instead of the actual `$0.10 / 2.99%`.
- Simplified the calculator contract in [web/lib/quoteTelemetry.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/quoteTelemetry.ts) so `SPREAD` is now always raw quote width plus percentage, and simplified [web/components/QuoteTelemetry.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/QuoteTelemetry.tsx) so the wrappers are layout wrappers only, not spread-policy wrappers.
- Rewired [web/components/TickerDetailModal.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/TickerDetailModal.tsx), [web/components/InstrumentDetailModal.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/InstrumentDetailModal.tsx), and [web/components/ModifyOrderModal.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/ModifyOrderModal.tsx) to the simplified shared wrappers so every live quote ladder now shows the same spread contract.
- The red phase failed across the full shared surface set: unit tests expected raw spread dollars and percent but still received notional dollars/bps (for example `$110.00 / 240 bps`, `$3,000.00 / 3,077 bps`, and `$0.60 / 1,538 bps`), and Playwright failed on all three browser flows before the calculator change.
- Verified green with `npx vitest run web/tests/quote-telemetry-wrappers.test.ts web/tests/price-bar-quote-telemetry.test.ts web/tests/ticker-detail-spread-notional.test.ts web/tests/order-ticket-spread-notional.test.ts web/tests/instrument-detail-spread-quantity.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/price-bar-quote-telemetry.spec.ts e2e/order-ticket-quote-telemetry.spec.ts e2e/modify-order-spread-telemetry.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`.

## Session: Investigate IB Index Subscription Warnings (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Determine why the live IB feed now reports missing market-data subscriptions for `VIX`, `VVIX`, and `COR1M`, even though those symbols were previously streaming in the application.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Record the investigation scope and constraints in `tasks/todo.md` before touching code or environment) depends_on: []
- T2 (Inspect the warning source and the current IB contract/data-type requests for `VIX`, `VVIX`, and `COR1M`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Review live logs and adjacent market-data flows to compare the current behavior against other index subscriptions and isolate the cause) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Summarize the root cause and remediation path without disturbing the loaded product services) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Record the investigation scope and constraints in `tasks/todo.md` before touching code or environment
- [x] T2 Inspect the warning source and the current IB contract/data-type requests for `VIX`, `VVIX`, and `COR1M`
- [x] T3 Review live logs and adjacent market-data flows to compare the current behavior against other index subscriptions and isolate the cause
- [x] T4 Summarize the root cause and remediation path without disturbing the loaded product services

### Review
- The warning string is emitted in [scripts/ib_realtime_server.js](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/ib_realtime_server.js) when the shared IB error handler sees code `354` or text matching `market data is not subscribed`. `/regime` subscribes `VIX@CBOE`, `VVIX@CBOE`, and `COR1M@CBOE` from [web/components/WorkspaceShell.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/WorkspaceShell.tsx), and the websocket hook in [web/lib/usePrices.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/usePrices.ts) forwards those index contracts unchanged.
- The current live websocket request shape is correct. A direct local IB repro on Thursday, March 12, 2026 using `ib.contract.index(symbol, "USD", "CBOE")`, `reqMarketDataType(4)`, and `reqMktData(..., "233,165", ...)` returned delayed ticks for `VIX`, `VVIX`, and `COR1M` without any `354` subscription error. Repeating the same repro with tick list `"233"` also succeeded.
- That means the warning is not explained by a permanent loss of current index entitlement or a broken contract-builder call. It is more likely noisy or transient in the websocket path. The UI can also look “live” because [web/components/RegimePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimePanel.tsx) falls back to cached CRI values when websocket values are absent.
- There is separate older evidence from Wednesday, March 11, 2026 in [logs/cri-scan.err.log](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/logs/cri-scan.err.log): the CRI scanner recorded `COR1M` failures including `Requested market data is not subscribed. Delayed market data is not enabled.` before falling back to Cboe/Yahoo. That is a different path from the websocket realtime server and should not be conflated with today’s direct websocket subscription repro.
- There is also a real cold-restore bug in [scripts/ib_realtime_server.js](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/ib_realtime_server.js): `restoreSubscriptions()` rebuilds missing contracts as stocks when no prior state exists. A direct repro showed that bug yields IB code `200` (`No security definition has been found for the request`) for `VIX`, `VVIX`, and `COR1M`, so it is worth fixing, but it does not match the specific `no market data subscription` warning you reported.

## Session: Stop Radon Dev Servers And Playwright Processes (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Stop the currently running Radon development servers and Playwright-related processes without touching the loaded background product services.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Record the narrowed process-stop scope in `tasks/todo.md` and capture the correction lesson in `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: []
- T2 (Inspect the live process table after the interrupted prior attempt and identify only the Radon dev-server and Playwright targets) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Terminate the targeted Radon dev-server and Playwright processes, then verify they are gone while launch agents remain untouched) depends_on: [T2]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Record the narrowed process-stop scope in `tasks/todo.md` and capture the correction lesson in `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T2 Inspect the live process table after the interrupted prior attempt and identify only the Radon dev-server and Playwright targets
- [x] T3 Terminate the targeted Radon dev-server and Playwright processes, then verify they are gone while launch agents remain untouched

### Review
- Identified the active targets after the interrupted prior attempt as the Radon web dev stack (`npm run dev:verbose:next`, `concurrently`, `next dev`, `ib_realtime_server.js`), the Radon site dev servers on ports `3335` and `3003`, the repo-scoped Playwright runner for `web/e2e/stale-option-last-price.spec.ts`, and the Playwright MCP bridge.
- Stopped those targets with targeted `pkill` and direct `kill` cleanup for one orphaned Playwright node process and one respawned Radon web dev stack tree. A final `ps` check showed no remaining Radon `next dev`, Playwright, Playwright MCP, or `ib_realtime_server.js` processes.
- Verified that the background product services were left untouched: `launchctl list` still shows `com.radon.cta-sync`, `com.radon.monitor-daemon`, and `local.ibc-gateway`.

## Session: Reduce CTA Auto Schedule To Two Post-Close Runs (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Change the CTA launch schedule so the service only runs automatically at 4:15 PM ET and 5:00 PM ET on trading days, while keeping `RunAtLoad` catch-up behavior for wake/login/reboot.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the current CTA schedule source, installer, tests, and docs, then record the corrected plan and lesson) depends_on: []
- T2 (Update regression coverage so the CTA schedule expects only the 4:15 PM ET and 5:00 PM ET automatic runs) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Implement the reduced CTA schedule in the source config and regenerate/reload the live LaunchAgent while preserving RunAtLoad catch-up semantics) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Update docs/status text and verify with tests plus live plist/launchctl inspection) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current CTA schedule source, installer, tests, and docs, then record the corrected plan and lesson
- [x] T2 Update regression coverage so the CTA schedule expects only the 4:15 PM ET and 5:00 PM ET automatic runs
- [x] T3 Implement the reduced CTA schedule in the source config and regenerate/reload the live LaunchAgent while preserving RunAtLoad catch-up semantics
- [x] T4 Update docs/status text and verify with tests plus live plist/launchctl inspection

### Review
- Reduced the CTA schedule source in [scripts/utils/cta_sync.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/utils/cta_sync.py) to two ET runs only: `4:15 PM` and `5:00 PM`. `RunAtLoad` remains enabled, so reboot/login/wake still provides catch-up for a missed closed-session refresh.
- Updated the installer/operator docs in [scripts/setup_cta_sync_service.sh](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/setup_cta_sync_service.sh), [scripts/run_cta_sync.sh](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/run_cta_sync.sh), and [README.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/README.md) so they describe the exact two-run schedule instead of the old multi-retry ladder.
- Fixed a small status-reporting bug in [scripts/setup_cta_sync_service.sh](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/setup_cta_sync_service.sh) so `status` now reports the newest daily `cta_YYYY-MM-DD.json` cache instead of accidentally matching `cta_sync_status.json`.
- Reloaded the live user LaunchAgent with `bash scripts/setup_cta_sync_service.sh install`. The generated plist at [com.radon.cta-sync.plist](/Users/joemccann/Library/LaunchAgents/com.radon.cta-sync.plist) now shows only `13:15` and `14:00` Pacific entries for weekdays, which correspond to `4:15 PM ET` and `5:00 PM ET`, and `launchctl print gui/501/com.radon.cta-sync` reflects the same schedule with `last exit code = 0`.
- Verification passed with `pytest -q scripts/tests/test_cta_sync_service.py`, `bash -n scripts/setup_cta_sync_service.sh scripts/run_cta_sync.sh`, `bash scripts/setup_cta_sync_service.sh install`, `bash scripts/setup_cta_sync_service.sh status`, `plutil -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.radon.cta-sync.plist`, and `launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.radon.cta-sync`.

## Session: Refactor Quote Telemetry To Shared Renderer And Wrappers (2026-03-12)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inventory existing quote renderers, calculators, and wrappers across ticker, instrument, and modify-order surfaces) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the refactor plan with dependency graph in `tasks/todo.md` before implementation) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Write or update unit and Playwright tests to pin the shared renderer/calculator contracts and observe red where needed) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement the refactor to a shared quote calculator, shared renderer, and surface-specific wrappers without changing validated semantics) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inventory existing quote renderers, calculators, and wrappers across ticker, instrument, and modify-order surfaces
- [x] T2 Record the refactor plan with dependency graph in `tasks/todo.md` before implementation
- [x] T3 Write or update unit and Playwright tests to pin the shared renderer/calculator contracts and observe red where needed
- [x] T4 Implement the refactor to a shared quote calculator, shared renderer, and surface-specific wrappers without changing validated semantics
- [x] T5 Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then capture review notes

### Review
- Consolidated quote math into [web/lib/quoteTelemetry.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/quoteTelemetry.ts), which is now the single calculator source for bid/mid/ask extraction, spread formatting, execution-spread formatting, and the full quote telemetry view model.
- Consolidated rendering into [web/components/QuoteTelemetry.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/QuoteTelemetry.tsx), which now owns the renderer variants and the thin wrappers: `TickerQuoteTelemetry`, `InstrumentOrderQuoteTelemetry`, and `ModifyOrderQuoteTelemetry`.
- Rewired [web/components/TickerDetailModal.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/TickerDetailModal.tsx), [web/components/InstrumentDetailModal.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/InstrumentDetailModal.tsx), and [web/components/ModifyOrderModal.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/ModifyOrderModal.tsx) to consume those wrappers instead of owning duplicated quote-row rendering and quote math.
- The red phase came from the new wrapper tests importing a non-existent shared quote component API: `npx vitest run web/tests/quote-telemetry-wrappers.test.ts web/tests/price-bar-quote-telemetry.test.ts` failed with `Cannot find module '../components/QuoteTelemetry'` before implementation.
- Added wrapper-level regression coverage in [web/tests/quote-telemetry-wrappers.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/quote-telemetry-wrappers.test.ts) and kept the existing modal/browser coverage for the shared ticker modal, instrument order modal, and modify-order modal.
- Verified green with `npx vitest run web/tests/quote-telemetry-wrappers.test.ts web/tests/price-bar-quote-telemetry.test.ts web/tests/ticker-detail-spread-notional.test.ts web/tests/order-ticket-spread-notional.test.ts web/tests/instrument-detail-spread-quantity.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/price-bar-quote-telemetry.spec.ts e2e/order-ticket-quote-telemetry.spec.ts e2e/modify-order-spread-telemetry.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`.

## Session: Load And Verify CTA Launch Agent (2026-03-12)

### Goal
Bootstrap the installed `com.radon.cta-sync` launch agent into the live user `launchd` domain and verify that it is actually loaded, triggerable, and writing the expected logs.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the installed CTA launch agent state and record the load/verification plan) depends_on: []
- T2 (Bootstrap or enable `com.radon.cta-sync` in the live `gui/501` launchd domain and trigger a verification run) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Verify the live launchd record, recent logs, and resulting CTA sync status, then document the outcome) depends_on: [T2]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the installed CTA launch agent state and record the load/verification plan
- [x] T2 Bootstrap or enable `com.radon.cta-sync` in the live `gui/501` launchd domain and trigger a verification run
- [x] T3 Verify the live launchd record, recent logs, and resulting CTA sync status, then document the outcome

### Review
- Bootstrapped the installed user agent with `launchctl bootstrap gui/501 ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.radon.cta-sync.plist` and then forced an immediate verification run with `launchctl kickstart -k gui/501/com.radon.cta-sync`.
- Verified the live launchd record with `launchctl print gui/501/com.radon.cta-sync`. The service is now loaded in the user GUI domain, has the expected `ProgramArguments` pointing at [scripts/run_cta_sync.sh](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/run_cta_sync.sh), shows the calendar triggers, and reports `runs = 2` with `last exit code = 0`.
- Verified the launchd registry with `launchctl list`, which now includes `com.radon.cta-sync` alongside `local.ibc-gateway` and `com.radon.monitor-daemon`.
- Verified runtime behavior from [logs/cta-sync.out.log](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/logs/cta-sync.out.log), [logs/cta-sync.err.log](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/logs/cta-sync.err.log), [cta-sync-latest.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/data/menthorq_cache/health/cta-sync-latest.json), and [cta-sync.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/data/service_health/cta-sync.json). The current run is healthy and skipped correctly because `cta_2026-03-11.json` is already present; the older March 11 auth failure remains visible only as historical log output.

## Session: Fix Modify-Order Spread Dollar Basis (2026-03-12)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the modify-order modal quote math and identify the intended spread basis from the current UI path) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the corrected plan and user-correction lesson in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Update unit and Playwright tests to the corrected modify-order spread contract and observe the red state) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement the minimal fix in `ModifyOrderModal` without regressing the shared ticker modal or instrument ticket behavior) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the modify-order modal quote math and identify the intended spread basis from the current UI path
- [x] T2 Record the corrected plan and user-correction lesson in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Update unit and Playwright tests to the corrected modify-order spread contract and observe the red state
- [x] T4 Implement the minimal fix in `ModifyOrderModal` without regressing the shared ticker modal or instrument ticket behavior
- [x] T5 Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then capture review notes

### Review
- Root cause: [web/components/ModifyOrderModal.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/ModifyOrderModal.tsx) was reusing order-sized spread math based on `order.totalQuantity * 100`, which made a quote-only telemetry row display `$4,000.00` for a `12.80 x 14.40` option quote. The operator-facing surface does not show quantity in that block, so the number was misleading.
- Added a modify-order-specific formatter in [web/lib/positionUtils.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/positionUtils.ts) that reports half-spread execution friction in displayed premium dollars and midpoint bps, and wired only [web/components/ModifyOrderModal.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/ModifyOrderModal.tsx) to use it.
- Locked the correction with unit coverage in [web/tests/order-ticket-spread-notional.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/order-ticket-spread-notional.test.ts) and browser coverage in [web/e2e/modify-order-spread-telemetry.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/modify-order-spread-telemetry.spec.ts). The red phase failed with `$3,000.00 / 3,077 bps` in unit tests and `$4,000.00 / 1,176 bps` in the browser before the fix.
- Verified green with `npx vitest run web/tests/order-ticket-spread-notional.test.ts web/tests/ticker-detail-spread-notional.test.ts web/tests/instrument-detail-spread-quantity.test.ts web/tests/price-bar-quote-telemetry.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/modify-order-spread-telemetry.spec.ts e2e/order-ticket-quote-telemetry.spec.ts e2e/price-bar-quote-telemetry.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`.

## Session: Separate Quote-Level And Order-Level Spread Notional (2026-03-12)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the shared ticker-detail quote path and confirm which surfaces should use quote-level vs quantity-sized spread notional) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the corrected plan and user-correction lesson in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Update regression tests to encode quote-level spread on the shared ticker modal and quantity-sized spread on explicit order surfaces, then observe red) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement the minimal fix so `TickerDetailModal` uses quote-level spread notional while `InstrumentDetailModal` and `ModifyOrderModal` stay quantity-aware) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the shared ticker-detail quote path and confirm which surfaces should use quote-level vs quantity-sized spread notional
- [x] T2 Record the corrected plan and user-correction lesson in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Update regression tests to encode quote-level spread on the shared ticker modal and quantity-sized spread on explicit order surfaces, then observe red
- [x] T4 Implement the minimal fix so `TickerDetailModal` uses quote-level spread notional while `InstrumentDetailModal` and `ModifyOrderModal` stay quantity-aware
- [x] T5 Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then capture review notes

### Review
- Root cause: the shared top quote bar in [web/components/TickerDetailModal.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/TickerDetailModal.tsx) was multiplying option spread width by `position.contracts`, even though that bar is shared across `Company`, `Position`, and `Order` tabs and does not own an explicit order quantity. That made general quote telemetry look like order-sized friction.
- Kept quantity-aware spread notional on the true order-sized surfaces: [web/components/InstrumentDetailModal.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/InstrumentDetailModal.tsx) still uses the displayed leg quantity, and [web/components/ModifyOrderModal.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/ModifyOrderModal.tsx) still uses `order.totalQuantity`.
- Added a focused regression in [web/tests/ticker-detail-spread-notional.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/ticker-detail-spread-notional.test.ts) plus browser coverage in [web/e2e/price-bar-quote-telemetry.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/price-bar-quote-telemetry.spec.ts) to lock the shared ticker modal to quote-level spread notional. The pre-fix red phase failed with `$2,200.00 / 240 bps` instead of `$110.00 / 240 bps`.
- Verified green with `npx vitest run web/tests/ticker-detail-spread-notional.test.ts web/tests/order-ticket-spread-notional.test.ts web/tests/instrument-detail-spread-quantity.test.ts web/tests/price-bar-quote-telemetry.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/price-bar-quote-telemetry.spec.ts e2e/order-ticket-quote-telemetry.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`.

## Session: Document And Ship Site Surface Fix (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the current `/site` fix worktree and identify the minimal doc touchpoints that should be updated before shipping) depends_on: []
- T2 (Update the relevant docs and record the ship plan in `tasks/todo.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Stage only the `/site` bug-fix, doc, and task-log files for this batch) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Create a scoped commit for the standalone-site surface fix and verification updates) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Push the current branch and capture the shipping review note) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current `/site` fix worktree and identify the minimal doc touchpoints that should be updated before shipping
- [x] T2 Update the relevant docs and record the ship plan in `tasks/todo.md`
- [x] T3 Stage only the `/site` bug-fix, doc, and task-log files for this batch
- [x] T4 Create a scoped commit for the standalone-site surface fix and verification updates
- [x] T5 Push the current branch and capture the shipping review note

### Review
- Shipped only the standalone-site surface fix batch: the compact preview-card metric treatment, the restored header theme toggle, the new browser regression for the surface-preview divider spacing, the small branding-spec lint cleanup, the site verification docs update, and the task log / lesson updates.
- Commit and push completed on `main` after the green standalone-site verification set: `cd web && npx playwright test branding.spec.ts theme-toggle.spec.ts surface-preview.spec.ts --config playwright.site.config.ts`, `cd site && npm run lint`, and `cd site && NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-build npm run build`.

## Session: Site Surface Metric Overflow Fix (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the `/site` surface-preview section and identify why the performance metric value bleeds into the adjacent tile at desktop width) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the bug-fix plan in `tasks/todo.md` and capture the user-correction lesson in `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage for the overflowing metric tile on the standalone site) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement the minimal layout fix in the shared site metric/tile components without regressing the existing brand treatment) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted verification, update review notes, and confirm the preview cards stay contained on desktop widths) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the `/site` surface-preview section and identify why the performance metric value bleeds into the adjacent tile at desktop width
- [x] T2 Record the bug-fix plan in `tasks/todo.md` and capture the user-correction lesson in `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for the overflowing metric tile on the standalone site
- [x] T4 Implement the minimal layout fix in the shared site metric/tile components without regressing the existing brand treatment
- [x] T5 Run targeted verification, update review notes, and confirm the preview cards stay contained on desktop widths

### Review
- Root cause: the `/site` surface-preview cards render split metric tiles through [site/components/organisms/SurfacePanelStack.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/components/organisms/SurfacePanelStack.tsx), but the shared mono metric in [site/components/atoms/MonoMetric.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/components/atoms/MonoMetric.tsx) used the same large value treatment as wider hero cards, leaving the `Institutional` value visually too tight to the divider in the narrower two-column tile layout.
- Added a failing browser regression in [site/e2e/surface-preview.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/e2e/surface-preview.spec.ts) that measures the rendered value against the adjacent tile at desktop width; the original rendering failed the divider-gap expectation before the UI patch.
- Implemented the fix by introducing a compact mono-metric treatment in [site/components/atoms/MonoMetric.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/components/atoms/MonoMetric.tsx) and applying it only to the preview-card metric grid in [site/components/organisms/SurfacePanelStack.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/components/organisms/SurfacePanelStack.tsx), preserving the larger hero-panel metric treatment while giving split tiles enough breathing room.
- Verification also exposed that the existing site theme-toggle coverage was broken because [site/components/sections/HeaderShell.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/components/sections/HeaderShell.tsx) no longer mounted the toggle. Restored the header toggle and cleaned a pre-existing lint issue in [site/e2e/branding.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/e2e/branding.spec.ts) so the focused standalone-site checks are green again.
- Verified with `cd web && npx playwright test surface-preview.spec.ts --config playwright.site.config.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test branding.spec.ts theme-toggle.spec.ts --config playwright.site.config.ts`, `cd site && npm run lint`, and `cd site && NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-build npm run build`.

## Session: Commit Residual Chart-System Fixes (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph

- T2 (Record the commit/push plan in `tasks/todo.md` before staging) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Stage the residual chart-system files and create a scoped commit with the verified runtime and OG routing fixes) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Push the current branch to origin and capture the resulting review note) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current branch, worktree, and diff so the commit only includes the residual chart-system follow-up files

- [x] T3 Stage the residual chart-system files and create a scoped commit with the verified runtime and OG routing fixes
- [x] T4 Push the current branch to origin and capture the resulting review note

### Review
- Staged only the residual chart-system follow-up files: the shared shell metadata update, relationship-view primitive convergence, MenthorQ OG family routing, focused Vitest/Playwright regressions, and the task log updates.
- Commit and push completed on `main` after the previously green verification set: `npx vitest run web/tests/chart-runtime-adoption.test.ts web/tests/price-chart-shell.test.ts web/tests/menthorq-og-route-contract.test.ts web/tests/chart-system.test.ts web/tests/og-theme-contract.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/price-chart-theme.spec.ts e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts`, and `cd web && npm run build`.

## Session: Chart System Residual Convergence (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the remaining chart-system residuals in the live-trace modal chart, relationship view shell, and MenthorQ OG route so the follow-up work stays scoped to the declared gaps) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the residual-convergence plan and user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage for live-trace shell metadata, relationship-view shared shell usage, and MenthorQ renderer-family selection) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement the runtime residual fixes for `PriceChart` and `RegimeRelationshipView` using the shared chart primitives with minimal visual regression) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Implement MenthorQ OG family-specific renderer routing for analytical time-series, distribution-bar, and matrix-heatmap outputs) depends_on: [T3]
- T6 (Run targeted verification, update review notes, and confirm the residual chart-system gaps are closed) depends_on: [T4, T5]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the remaining chart-system residuals in the live-trace modal chart, relationship view shell, and MenthorQ OG route so the follow-up work stays scoped to the declared gaps
- [x] T2 Record the residual-convergence plan and user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for live-trace shell metadata, relationship-view shared shell usage, and MenthorQ renderer-family selection
- [x] T4 Implement the runtime residual fixes for `PriceChart` and `RegimeRelationshipView` using the shared chart primitives with minimal visual regression
- [x] T5 Implement MenthorQ OG family-specific renderer routing for analytical time-series, distribution-bar, and matrix-heatmap outputs
- [x] T6 Run targeted verification, update review notes, and confirm the residual chart-system gaps are closed

### Review
- Runtime slice completed: [web/components/charts/ChartPanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/charts/ChartPanel.tsx) now emits chart-family and renderer metadata on the chart shell root, and [web/components/PriceChart.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/PriceChart.tsx) now adopts that shell as a `live-trace` surface so the modal chart participates in the shared chart-system contract instead of bypassing it.
- Updated [web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx) and [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) so the relationship view keeps the shared `ChartPanel` shell while the z-score legend uses the shared `ChartLegend` primitive without the legacy standalone legend styling hook.
- Added direct runtime regression coverage in [web/tests/price-chart-shell.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/price-chart-shell.test.ts), [web/tests/chart-runtime-adoption.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/chart-runtime-adoption.test.ts), [web/e2e/price-chart-theme.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/price-chart-theme.spec.ts), and [web/e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts); targeted Vitest and Playwright verification passed for the runtime slice.
- Downstream slice completed: [web/tests/menthorq-og-route-contract.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/menthorq-og-route-contract.test.ts) now exercises the MenthorQ OG route as code instead of string-matching source, covering analytical time-series, distribution-bar, matrix-heatmap, and unsupported-shape fallback selection.
- Updated [web/app/api/menthorq/[command]/image/route.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/api/menthorq/[command]/image/route.tsx) to replace the generic analytical-only fallback with explicit family routing: command hints now prefer `intraday` and `cryptos_technical` as `analytical-time-series`, `vol`/`eod`/`futures`/`cryptos_options` as `distribution-bar`, and `forex` as `matrix-heatmap`, while unsupported payloads keep the command-family badge and render a clear fallback message instead of a misleading line chart.
- Final targeted verification passed with `npx vitest run web/tests/chart-runtime-adoption.test.ts web/tests/price-chart-shell.test.ts web/tests/menthorq-og-route-contract.test.ts web/tests/chart-system.test.ts web/tests/og-theme-contract.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/price-chart-theme.spec.ts e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts`, and `cd web && npm run build`; the only remaining build note is the pre-existing Next `metadataBase` warning, and the residual chart-system convergence session is now closed.

## Session: Regime Relationship State Tooltips (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the current RVOL/COR1M relationship quadrant UI, shared tooltip component, and existing tooltip test patterns) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the implementation plan in `tasks/todo.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage for a four-state tooltip key in the relationship view) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement info-bubble triggers for all four relationship states in the `/regime` UI without disturbing the existing quadrant plot) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted verification and capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current RVOL/COR1M relationship quadrant UI, shared tooltip component, and existing tooltip test patterns
- [x] T2 Record the implementation plan in `tasks/todo.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for a four-state tooltip key in the relationship view
- [x] T4 Implement info-bubble triggers for all four relationship states in the `/regime` UI without disturbing the existing quadrant plot
- [x] T5 Run targeted verification and capture review notes

### Review
- Added shared state-definition copy in [web/lib/regimeRelationships.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/regimeRelationships.ts) so the four relationship states now have one canonical tooltip definition source.
- Updated [web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx) to render a `STATE KEY` under the quadrant chart with one `InfoTooltip` trigger per state, while preserving the existing quadrant visualization and current-state summary.
- Extended [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) with responsive styling for the new state-key rows so the tooltip affordances stay aligned with the existing instrument-panel system on desktop and mobile.
- Added regression coverage in [web/tests/regime-relationship-tooltips.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-relationship-tooltips.test.ts) and browser coverage in [web/e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts).
- Verified `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-relationship-tooltips.test.ts web/tests/regime-relationship.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts`.

## Session: Regime Relationship State Docs (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect README and strategy/docs surfaces that describe `/regime`, CRI, and the new RVOL/COR1M relationship states) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the documentation plan and the user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Update README and the relevant markdown docs with exact definitions for the four relationship states and the rolling-mean classification rule) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Verify the updated documentation against the current implementation and capture review notes) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect README and strategy/docs surfaces that describe `/regime`, CRI, and the new RVOL/COR1M relationship states
- [x] T2 Record the documentation plan and the user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Update README and the relevant markdown docs with exact definitions for the four relationship states and the rolling-mean classification rule
- [x] T4 Verify the updated documentation against the current implementation and capture review notes

### Review
- Added operator-facing definitions for all four relationship states in [README.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/README.md), alongside the `/regime` terminal capabilities section, so the meaning of `FRAGILE CALM`, `SYSTEMIC PANIC`, `STOCK PICKER'S MARKET`, and `GOLDILOCKS` is visible without reading the code.
- Added the exact implementation rule to the CRI strategy spec in [docs/strategies.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/docs/strategies.md): the relationship view classifies the latest RVOL/COR1M point against the rolling 20-session means, not against fixed absolute cutoffs.
- Verified the docs against the current implementation in [web/lib/regimeRelationships.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/regimeRelationships.ts), including the live-latest-point override behavior used by `/regime`.

## Session: Chart System Roadmap Steps 1-4 (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the current chart surfaces, audit roadmap, and available cross-language primitive hooks so a shared chart-system contract can drive runtime and downstream outputs) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the step-1-through-4 execution plan in `tasks/todo.md`, including the shared chart-spec artifacts and validation targets) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Implement the shared chart spec, runtime chart shell/primitives, and tokenized chart helpers in `web/`) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Converge OG/report surfaces and sanctioned renderer documentation onto the new chart-system rules) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Add/update regression coverage where practical, run targeted verification, and capture review notes) depends_on: [T3, T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current chart surfaces, audit roadmap, and available cross-language primitive hooks so a shared chart-system contract can drive runtime and downstream outputs
- [x] T2 Record the step-1-through-4 execution plan in `tasks/todo.md`, including the shared chart-spec artifacts and validation targets
- [x] T3 Implement the shared chart spec, runtime chart shell/primitives, and tokenized chart helpers in `web/`
- [x] T4 Converge OG/report surfaces and sanctioned renderer documentation onto the new chart-system rules
- [x] T5 Add/update regression coverage where practical, run targeted verification, and capture review notes

### Review
- Published the shared chart contract in [web/lib/chart-system-spec.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/chart-system-spec.json), exposed runtime helpers in [web/lib/chartSystem.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/chartSystem.ts), and documented the sanctioned families/renderers in [docs/chart-system.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/docs/chart-system.md).
- Extracted shared runtime chart primitives in [web/components/charts/ChartPanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/charts/ChartPanel.tsx) and [web/components/charts/ChartLegend.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/charts/ChartLegend.tsx), then adopted them in [web/components/PerformancePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/PerformancePanel.tsx) and [web/components/CriHistoryChart.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/CriHistoryChart.tsx), while routing runtime series colors through semantic roles in [web/components/RegimePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimePanel.tsx) and [web/components/PriceChart.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/PriceChart.tsx).
- Converged downstream surfaces on the same contract by wiring [web/lib/og-theme.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/og-theme.ts), restoring and aligning [web/lib/og-charts.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/og-charts.tsx), tightening [web/app/api/menthorq/[command]/image/route.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/api/menthorq/[command]/image/route.tsx), and keeping [scripts/performance_explainer_report.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/performance_explainer_report.py) on the shared family/renderer/semantic-role rules.
- Added regression coverage in [web/tests/chart-system.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/chart-system.test.ts), [web/tests/chart-runtime-adoption.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/chart-runtime-adoption.test.ts), [web/tests/og-theme-contract.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/og-theme-contract.test.ts), [web/tests/og-chart-contract.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/og-chart-contract.test.ts), [web/tests/og-chart-system.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/og-chart-system.test.ts), [web/tests/menthorq-og-route-contract.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/menthorq-og-route-contract.test.ts), and [scripts/tests/test_performance_explainer_report.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/tests/test_performance_explainer_report.py).
- Verified with `npx vitest run web/tests/chart-system.test.ts web/tests/chart-runtime-adoption.test.ts web/tests/og-chart-contract.test.ts web/tests/menthorq-og-route-contract.test.ts web/tests/og-theme-contract.test.ts web/tests/og-chart-system.test.ts web/tests/performance-chart-model.test.ts web/tests/performance-chart-theme.test.ts web/tests/performance-chart-axes.test.ts web/tests/regime-history-responsive.test.ts web/tests/regime-history-tooltip.test.ts web/tests/price-chart-theme.test.ts`, `pytest scripts/tests/test_performance_explainer_report.py -q`, `python3 -m py_compile scripts/performance_explainer_report.py`, `python3 scripts/performance_explainer_report.py --no-open --output /tmp/performance-page-explainer-chart-audit.html`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/performance-page.spec.ts e2e/performance-chart-axes.spec.ts e2e/performance-chart-theme.spec.ts e2e/regime-history-responsive.spec.ts e2e/regime-history-tooltip.spec.ts`, and `cd web && npm run build`.
- Residual gaps intentionally left for later follow-up: [web/components/PriceChart.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/PriceChart.tsx) still does not emit `live-trace` shell metadata because it renders inside other panels; [web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx) still uses its own section/legend system; and the generic MenthorQ OG route still falls back to an analytical time-series renderer for arbitrary datasets until command-specific `distribution-bar` and `matrix-heatmap` renderers are added.

## Session: Regime Relationship Analytics View (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the `/regime` history data shape, current chart contracts, and brand constraints so relationship-first analytics can be added without removing the raw history view) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the relationship-analytics plan and the user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage for the new RVOL/COR1M relationship helpers and browser-visible analytics panels) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement additive relationship visuals for spread, quadrant, and normalized divergence with minimal impact to the existing charts) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted verification, update review notes, and confirm the new panels are green without regressing the raw history charts) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the `/regime` history data shape, current chart contracts, and brand constraints so relationship-first analytics can be added without removing the raw history view
- [x] T2 Record the relationship-analytics plan and the user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for the new RVOL/COR1M relationship helpers and browser-visible analytics panels
- [x] T4 Implement additive relationship visuals for spread, quadrant, and normalized divergence with minimal impact to the existing charts
- [x] T5 Run targeted verification, update review notes, and confirm the new panels are green without regressing the raw history charts

### Review
- Added a dedicated relationship analytics helper in [web/lib/regimeRelationships.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/regimeRelationships.ts) so spread, quadrant, and normalized divergence all derive from the same filtered RVOL/COR1M series, with live overrides merged into the latest session when present.
- Wired an additive relationship section into [web/components/RegimePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimePanel.tsx) and implemented the three analytics panels in [web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx), preserving the original raw history charts and their existing test hooks.
- Extended the styling in [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) to keep the new panels on the current instrument-panel system and added tooltip copy in [web/lib/sectionTooltips.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/sectionTooltips.ts).
- Verified the relationship helper with `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-relationship-model.test.ts`.
- Verified the browser behavior with `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts e2e/regime-rvol-history.spec.ts`, proving the new panels render while the legacy raw RVOL history chart still keeps its 20-point contract.
- Verified the web app compiles with `cd web && npm run build`. The first Turbopack attempt left a stale `.next` temp/lock artifact, but the rerun after clearing the lock completed successfully.

## Session: Repo-Wide Chart Cohesion Audit (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inventory every non-sparkline chart across runtime app code and adjacent repo surfaces, separating live product charts from mockups, OG assets, and report-only visuals) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the chart-audit plan in `tasks/todo.md`, including the target HTML artifact path and review criteria) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Use subagents to compare chart implementations, shared behaviors, divergence points, and brand alignment across runtime/design surfaces) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Generate a cohesive-charting HTML report with findings, taxonomy, and refactor recommendations grounded in the brand system) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Open the HTML report locally, capture validation notes, and summarize the highest-priority conclusions) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inventory every non-sparkline chart across runtime app code and adjacent repo surfaces, separating live product charts from mockups, OG assets, and report-only visuals
- [x] T2 Record the chart-audit plan in `tasks/todo.md`, including the target HTML artifact path and review criteria

- [x] T4 Generate a cohesive-charting HTML report with findings, taxonomy, and refactor recommendations grounded in the brand system
- [x] T5 Open the HTML report locally, capture validation notes, and summarize the highest-priority conclusions

### Report Artifact
- Target: `reports/chart-audit-2026-03-11.html`

### Review
- Inventoried the runtime product chart surfaces under `web/` as four families instead of one: live scrub price chart ([web/components/PriceChart.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/PriceChart.tsx)), analytical time-series ([web/components/PerformancePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/PerformancePanel.tsx), [web/components/CriHistoryChart.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/CriHistoryChart.tsx)), distribution/gauge visuals ([web/components/RegimePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimePanel.tsx), [web/components/CtaPage.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/CtaPage.tsx), [web/components/ticker-detail/RatingsTab.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/ticker-detail/RatingsTab.tsx)), and matrix/heatmap-style comparative views ([web/components/ticker-detail/SeasonalityTab.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/ticker-detail/SeasonalityTab.tsx), [web/components/CtaTables.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/CtaTables.tsx)).
- Audited secondary repo references that should influence the eventual chart system without defining runtime behavior: [web/lib/og-charts.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/og-charts.tsx), [web/app/api/menthorq/[command]/image/route.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/api/menthorq/[command]/image/route.tsx), [brand/radon-terminal-mockup.html](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/brand/radon-terminal-mockup.html), [brand/radon-component-kit.html](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/brand/radon-component-kit.html), [scripts/performance_explainer_report.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/performance_explainer_report.py), and [.pi/skills/html-report/THEME.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/.pi/skills/html-report/THEME.md).
- Generated the report at [reports/chart-audit-2026-03-11.html](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/reports/chart-audit-2026-03-11.html). The report documents the current chart taxonomy, same-vs-different analysis, brand-alignment gaps, and a four-step refactor roadmap centered on a shared chart spec rather than a forced single-library rewrite.
- Highest-priority conclusions captured in the report: there is no shared chart shell yet; runtime charts currently span canvas, D3 SVG, custom SVG, and CSS/flex/grid implementations; theme-token adoption is strongest on `/performance` and weakest in `CriHistoryChart` and the modal bar/grid views; and the repo already contains one viable cross-surface chart grammar in [web/lib/og-charts.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/og-charts.tsx), but it is isolated to OG rendering instead of driving runtime and report visuals.
- Tried to open the report with `open` first, but this shell has no working default HTML handler and the installed browser bundles are stubs. Fell back to Quick Look via `qlmanage -p reports/chart-audit-2026-03-11.html`.

## Session: Regime History Charts Responsive Stack (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the `/regime` history-chart layout path, current chart container markup, and responsive CSS gaps) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the responsive-stack fix plan in `tasks/todo.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage for narrow-viewport chart stacking in unit tests and Playwright) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Replace the inline two-column history grid with responsive CSS that stacks the charts vertically at narrow widths) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted verification and capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the `/regime` history-chart layout path, current chart container markup, and responsive CSS gaps
- [x] T2 Record the responsive-stack fix plan in `tasks/todo.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for narrow-viewport chart stacking in unit tests and Playwright
- [x] T4 Replace the inline two-column history grid with responsive CSS that stacks the charts vertically at narrow widths
- [x] T5 Run targeted verification and capture review notes

### Review
- Replaced the inline history-chart grid in [RegimePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimePanel.tsx) with a named `regime-history-grid` container so the layout is controlled by CSS instead of a fixed in-component `1fr 1fr` declaration.
- Added responsive rules in [globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) that keep the two charts side by side on wide screens and collapse them to a single stacked column below `960px`, preserving the existing 16px gap and top alignment.
- Locked the contract with [regime-history-responsive.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-history-responsive.test.ts) and [regime-history-responsive.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-history-responsive.spec.ts), then reran the adjacent history tooltip coverage in [regime-history-tooltip.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-history-tooltip.test.ts) and [regime-history-tooltip.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-history-tooltip.spec.ts).
- Verified `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-history-responsive.test.ts web/tests/regime-history-tooltip.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-history-responsive.spec.ts e2e/regime-history-tooltip.spec.ts`.

## Session: Performance Chart Axes Fix (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the `/performance` chart implementation, existing axis styling patterns, and relevant test harnesses) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the bug-fix plan and user correction lesson in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage for visible performance-chart axes in unit tests and Playwright) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement YTD chart axes and labels with minimal layout impact) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted verification, update review notes, and confirm green state) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the `/performance` chart implementation, existing axis styling patterns, and relevant test harnesses
- [x] T2 Record the bug-fix plan and user correction lesson in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for visible performance-chart axes in unit tests and Playwright
- [x] T4 Implement YTD chart axes and labels with minimal layout impact
- [x] T5 Run targeted verification, update review notes, and confirm green state

### Review
- Added a shared chart model in [web/lib/performanceChart.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/performanceChart.ts) so the YTD equity line, rebased benchmark line, filled area, and new axis ticks all derive from one domain instead of separate per-line scaling.
- Updated [web/components/PerformancePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/PerformancePanel.tsx) so the `YTD Equity Curve` now renders an explicit left value axis, a bottom date axis, and stable `performance-axis-x-label` / `performance-axis-y-label` hooks for browser coverage.
- Updated [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) with `performance-axis-line` and `performance-axis-label` styles so the new axes inherit the existing IBM Plex Mono telemetry treatment and the current theme tokens.
- Added unit coverage in [web/tests/performance-chart-model.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/performance-chart-model.test.ts) for shared-domain chart math and axis tick generation, plus browser coverage in [web/e2e/performance-chart-axes.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/performance-chart-axes.spec.ts) for visible x/y labels on `/performance`.
- Kept the adjacent light-theme regression aligned by updating [web/e2e/performance-chart-theme.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/performance-chart-theme.spec.ts) to assert against the browser’s current gradient serialization instead of an overly exact `rgb(...)` string.
- Verified `npx vitest run web/tests/performance-chart-model.test.ts web/tests/performance-chart-theme.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/performance-page.spec.ts e2e/performance-chart-theme.spec.ts e2e/performance-chart-axes.spec.ts`, and `cd web && npm run build`.

## Session: Regime COR1M Day-Over-Day Baseline Fix (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the live COR1M strip calculation, compare the IB close field against the CRI/Cboe prior close, and isolate the incorrect day-over-day baseline) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the correction plan and lesson update in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage proving COR1M day change must anchor to the prior CRI/Cboe close instead of the IB websocket close field) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement the baseline fix in the `/regime` render path with minimal UI impact) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted unit and Playwright verification, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the live COR1M strip calculation, compare the IB close field against the CRI/Cboe prior close, and isolate the incorrect day-over-day baseline
- [x] T2 Record the correction plan and lesson update in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage proving COR1M day change must anchor to the prior CRI/Cboe close instead of the IB websocket close field
- [x] T4 Implement the baseline fix in the `/regime` render path with minimal UI impact
- [x] T5 Run targeted unit and Playwright verification, then capture review notes

### Review
- Updated [cri_scan.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/cri_scan.py) so the CRI payload now preserves `cor1m_previous_close` from the unmodified Cboe daily history and stops overwriting the last historical COR1M bar with the intraday override. The root `cor1m` field can still reflect the best current quote, but the UI now has a clean prior-session anchor.
- Updated [route.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/api/regime/route.ts), [useRegime.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/useRegime.ts), and [RegimePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimePanel.tsx) so the COR1M strip’s day-over-day line uses `data.cor1m_previous_close` (falling back to the last history bar) instead of `prices["COR1M"].close`.
- Locked the payload and UI contract with [test_cri_scan.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py), [regime-cor1m-live.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-cor1m-live.test.ts), and browser assertions in [regime-cor1m-live-stream.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-cor1m-live-stream.spec.ts), while keeping adjacent regime regressions green in [regime-cor1m.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-cor1m.spec.ts) and [regime-day-change.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-day-change.spec.ts).
- Refreshed the live cache with `bash scripts/run_cri_scan.sh`. [cri.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/data/cri.json) now has `date=2026-03-10`, `cor1m_previous_close=28.97`, and `history[-1].cor1m=28.97`, and the newest scheduled snapshot at [cri-2026-03-11T13-51.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/data/cri_scheduled/cri-2026-03-11T13-51.json) matches that corrected baseline.
- Verified `pytest scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py -q`, `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-cor1m-live.test.ts`, `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-market-closed-values.test.ts web/tests/regime-market-closed.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-cor1m-live-stream.spec.ts e2e/regime-cor1m.spec.ts e2e/regime-day-change.spec.ts`, and `bash scripts/run_cri_scan.sh`.

## Session: Performance Chart Theme Fix (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the `/performance` chart implementation, current theme plumbing, and existing chart-theme test patterns) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the bug-fix plan and user correction lesson in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage for performance-chart theme behavior in unit tests and Playwright) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement light-theme-aware chart and chart-meta styling on `/performance` with minimal UI changes) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted verification, update review notes, and confirm green state) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the `/performance` chart implementation, current theme plumbing, and existing chart-theme test patterns
- [x] T2 Record the bug-fix plan and user correction lesson in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for performance-chart theme behavior in unit tests and Playwright
- [x] T4 Implement light-theme-aware chart and chart-meta styling on `/performance` with minimal UI changes
- [x] T5 Run targeted verification, update review notes, and confirm green state

### Review
- Updated [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) so the `/performance` chart surface, grid lines, benchmark stroke, and chart meta tiles now use dedicated theme variables instead of hardcoded dark RGBA values. The dark palette preserves the existing look; the light palette now switches the chart to a bright neutral surface that matches the rest of the app.
- Added source-level regression coverage in [web/tests/performance-chart-theme.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/performance-chart-theme.test.ts) to lock the CSS contract on `--performance-chart-bg`, `--performance-chart-grid`, and `--performance-chart-meta-bg`.
- Added browser coverage in [web/e2e/performance-chart-theme.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/performance-chart-theme.spec.ts), which starts `/performance` in dark mode, toggles to light, and asserts that both the chart surface and the meta tiles actually change palette.
- Verified `npx vitest run web/tests/performance-chart-theme.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/performance-chart-theme.spec.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/performance-page.spec.ts e2e/performance-chart-theme.spec.ts`, and `cd web && npm run build`.

## Session: Regime COR1M Strip Pattern Alignment (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the current COR1M strip card layout and the neighboring strip-card pattern the user wants matched) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the user correction and implementation plan in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage for COR1M daily-change placement and 5d-change subline behavior) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement the COR1M strip layout so it shows the daily change line and moves 5d change into the subline) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted unit and Playwright verification, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current COR1M strip card layout and the neighboring strip-card pattern the user wants matched
- [x] T2 Record the user correction and implementation plan in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for COR1M daily-change placement and 5d-change subline behavior
- [x] T4 Implement the COR1M strip layout so it shows the daily change line and moves 5d change into the subline
- [x] T5 Run targeted unit and Playwright verification, then capture review notes

### Review
- Updated [RegimePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimePanel.tsx) so the COR1M strip now matches the neighboring metric-card hierarchy: live value first, the standard `DayChange` line from IB `last` vs `close` second, and the cached 5-session context moved into the muted `regime-strip-sub` line.
- Preserved the existing live-COR1M behavior from the earlier fix by keeping `prices["COR1M"].last` as the displayed intraday value, but added the missing `prices["COR1M"].close` input so the daily move and arrow render the same way as VIX, VVIX, and SPY.
- Locked the layout contract with source-level assertions in [regime-cor1m-live.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-cor1m-live.test.ts) and browser assertions in [regime-cor1m-live-stream.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-cor1m-live-stream.spec.ts), [regime-cor1m.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-cor1m.spec.ts), and [regime-day-change.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-day-change.spec.ts).
- Verified `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-cor1m-live.test.ts`, `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-market-closed-values.test.ts web/tests/regime-market-closed.test.ts`, and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-cor1m-live-stream.spec.ts e2e/regime-cor1m.spec.ts e2e/regime-day-change.spec.ts`.

## Session: Regime COR1M Live Feed Wiring (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the current `/regime` COR1M render path, IB subscription inputs, and existing test coverage to isolate why live COR1M is not displayed) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the user correction and live-feed implementation plan in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage for live COR1M rendering and badge behavior on `/regime`) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement live COR1M preference from the IB price stream with cached CRI fallback and preserve the daily 5d change context) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted unit and Playwright verification, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current `/regime` COR1M render path, IB subscription inputs, and existing test coverage to isolate why live COR1M is not displayed
- [x] T2 Record the user correction and live-feed implementation plan in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for live COR1M rendering and badge behavior on `/regime`
- [x] T4 Implement live COR1M preference from the IB price stream with cached CRI fallback and preserve the daily 5d change context
- [x] T5 Run targeted unit and Playwright verification, then capture review notes

### Review
- Updated [RegimePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimePanel.tsx) so `/regime` now prefers `prices["COR1M"].last` during market hours, falls back to `data.cor1m` when no live tick is available, and carries the live COR1M value into the correlation component, crash-trigger row, and RVOL/COR1M history chart.
- Kept the existing CRI-derived 5-session change context intact, so the COR1M strip still shows the cached `data.cor1m_5d_change` while the main displayed COR1M level can update from IB in real time.
- Added source-level regression coverage in [regime-cor1m-live.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-cor1m-live.test.ts) and browser coverage in [regime-cor1m-live-stream.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-cor1m-live-stream.spec.ts) with a mocked websocket COR1M tick.
- Updated [CLAUDE.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/CLAUDE.md) so the repo spec now matches the runtime behavior: COR1M remains daily-only when the market is closed, but can render live from IB during market hours.
- Verified `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-cor1m-live.test.ts web/tests/regime-market-closed-values.test.ts web/tests/regime-market-closed.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-cor1m-live-stream.spec.ts e2e/regime-market-closed-eod.spec.ts e2e/regime-cor1m.spec.ts`.

## Session: Regime History Tooltip Copy And Placement (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the Regime history header, shared tooltip copy, and existing unit/Playwright test patterns for the smallest safe fix) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the user-facing fix plan and correction lesson in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage for the 20-session history header contract and tooltip copy on `/regime`) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement the history-header layout adjustment and rewrite the tooltip copy to explain the visible data without implementation details) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted unit and Playwright verification, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the Regime history header, shared tooltip copy, and existing unit/Playwright test patterns for the smallest safe fix
- [x] T2 Record the user-facing fix plan and correction lesson in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for the 20-session history header contract and tooltip copy on `/regime`
- [x] T4 Implement the history-header layout adjustment and rewrite the tooltip copy to explain the visible data without implementation details
- [x] T5 Run targeted unit and Playwright verification, then capture review notes

### Review
- Reworked the history header in [web/components/RegimePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimePanel.tsx) so the `20-SESSION HISTORY` label and `?` icon now live in a shared `section-title` group while the optional `LIVE` badge remains on the right edge of the section header.
- Extended [web/components/InfoTooltip.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/InfoTooltip.tsx) with optional test ids so the history tooltip can be targeted directly in browser coverage without changing behavior for the other tooltips in the app.
- Replaced the stale implementation-oriented history copy in [web/lib/sectionTooltips.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/sectionTooltips.ts) with a `20-SESSION HISTORY` entry that explains what the left and right charts mean in user-facing terms and removes D3/WS/websocket references.
- Added a source-level regression in [web/tests/regime-history-tooltip.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-history-tooltip.test.ts) and a browser regression in [web/e2e/regime-history-tooltip.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-history-tooltip.spec.ts) to lock the header grouping, tooltip trigger placement, and plain-English copy.
- Verified `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-history-tooltip.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-history-tooltip.spec.ts`, and `cd web && npm run build` all pass.

## Session: CRI Cache Refresh Remediation (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the live CRI cache artifacts, the current scanner failure mode, and why `/regime` is still serving missing RVOL history) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the remediation plan and the user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage for the CBOE-before-Yahoo COR1M fallback and for live `/regime` RVOL history visibility) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement the CBOE COR1M fallback plus doc updates, then ensure the route-visible CRI cache and newest scheduled snapshot are valid) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Verify the regenerated cache contents and targeted tests, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the live CRI cache artifacts, the current scanner failure mode, and why `/regime` is still serving missing RVOL history
- [x] T2 Record the remediation plan and the user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for the CBOE-before-Yahoo COR1M fallback and for live `/regime` RVOL history visibility
- [x] T4 Implement the CBOE COR1M fallback plus doc updates, then ensure the route-visible CRI cache and newest scheduled snapshot are valid
- [x] T5 Verify the regenerated cache contents and targeted tests, then capture review notes

### Review
- Updated [scripts/cri_scan.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/cri_scan.py) so COR1M history and fallback quote selection now use the official Cboe dashboard feed before Yahoo Finance, while preserving the earlier IB client-id retry path.
- Added regression coverage in [scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py) for the new source order and in [web/e2e/regime-rvol-history-live-cache.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-rvol-history-live-cache.spec.ts) for the browser-visible “20 RVOL dots from live cache” contract.
- Updated [README.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/README.md), [docs/strategies.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/docs/strategies.md), [.pi/AGENTS.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/.pi/AGENTS.md), [.pi/prompts/cri-scan.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/.pi/prompts/cri-scan.md), and [.pi/skills/html-report/SKILL.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/.pi/skills/html-report/SKILL.md) so the repo now documents the COR1M source order as IB → official Cboe dashboard feed → Yahoo last resort.
- Confirmed the route-visible cache state is valid now: [data/cri.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/data/cri.json) has 20 history rows, 20 numeric `realized_vol` values, and 40 cached `spy_closes`; a fresh valid scheduled snapshot was also written at [cri-2026-03-11T13-24.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/data/cri_scheduled/cri-2026-03-11T13-24.json).
- Verified the final path with `python3 scripts/cri_scan.py --json > /tmp/cri-refresh.json`, `bash scripts/run_cri_scan.sh`, `pytest scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py scripts/tests/test_cri_client_id.py -q`, `npx playwright test e2e/regime-rvol-history-live-cache.spec.ts e2e/regime-cor1m-live-route.spec.ts`, `bash -n scripts/run_cri_scan.sh`, and `bash -n scripts/run_data_refresh.sh`.

## Session: Site Light Theme Toggle (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Audit the `/site` theme surface, existing header structure, and available unit/E2E test harnesses without disturbing unrelated worktree changes) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the light-theme implementation and verification plan in `tasks/todo.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage for site theme state resolution, header toggle rendering, and browser-visible light/dark switching) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement the `/site` light theme tokens, persisted theme toggle button, and hydration-safe root theme wiring) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted verification for unit tests, site lint/build, and the site Playwright E2E flow, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Audit the `/site` theme surface, existing header structure, and available unit/E2E test harnesses without disturbing unrelated worktree changes
- [x] T2 Record the light-theme implementation and verification plan in `tasks/todo.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for site theme state resolution, header toggle rendering, and browser-visible light/dark switching
- [x] T4 Implement the `/site` light theme tokens, persisted theme toggle button, and hydration-safe root theme wiring
- [x] T5 Run targeted verification for unit tests, site lint/build, and the site Playwright E2E flow, then capture review notes

### Review
- Added the site theme state contract in [theme.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/lib/theme.ts) and covered it in [theme.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/lib/theme.test.ts), so the site now resolves a saved `theme` preference first, falls back to the browser color-scheme when no saved value exists, and exposes a deterministic dark/light toggle path.
- Wired the persisted theme into the document shell in [layout.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/layout.tsx) with a bootstrap script plus `html[data-theme]`, which lets the marketing site switch palettes before hydration while still keeping the rest of the page server-rendered.
- Reused the in-progress client boundary in [ThemeToggle.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/components/atoms/ThemeToggle.tsx) and mounted it in [HeaderShell.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/components/sections/HeaderShell.tsx), adding a header-level toggle button that persists to `localStorage`, updates the `theme-color` meta tag, and remains keyboard accessible.
- Expanded the semantic token overrides in [globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/globals.css) so the site gets a true light theme without breaking the Radon terminal geometry; also updated the accent-button text in [page.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/page.tsx), [HeroSection.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/components/sections/HeroSection.tsx), [HeaderShell.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/components/sections/HeaderShell.tsx), and [FinalCTASection.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/components/sections/FinalCTASection.tsx) so the CTA contrast stays correct in light mode.
- Added a site-specific Playwright harness in [playwright.site.config.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/playwright.site.config.ts) and the browser regression in [theme-toggle.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/e2e/theme-toggle.spec.ts), which proves the site honors a saved light theme on load and persists dark→light toggles in the browser.
- Updated [site/.gitignore](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/.gitignore) and [site/eslint.config.mjs](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/eslint.config.mjs) so the dedicated `.next-site-playwright/` dev output used by the site E2E harness stays out of git status and lint.
- Verified `npx vitest run site/lib/theme.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test theme-toggle.spec.ts --config playwright.site.config.ts`, `cd site && npm run lint`, and `cd site && NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-build npm run build`.

## Session: Site Docs Checkpoint And SEO Audit (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Audit the current `/site` worktree, documentation gaps, generated artifact noise, and the unresolved non-site WIP that must stay out of the checkpoint commit) depends_on: []
- T2 (Update docs and ignore rules for the landing-page batch, then create a scoped checkpoint commit for finished `/site` work only) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Audit the live `/site` SEO surface, identify crawl/indexation/share gaps, and write failing or objective verification around the new SEO contract where practical) depends_on: [T1]
- T4 (Implement the `/site` SEO remediations, generate and open an HTML audit report with recommendations, and document the workflow) depends_on: [T2, T3]
- T5 (Run targeted verification for metadata/routes/build/report generation, then capture review notes and a second scoped commit for the SEO pass) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Audit the current `/site` worktree, documentation gaps, generated artifact noise, and the unresolved non-site WIP that must stay out of the checkpoint commit
- [ ] T2 Update docs and ignore rules for the landing-page batch, then create a scoped checkpoint commit for finished `/site` work only
- [x] T3 Audit the live `/site` SEO surface, identify crawl/indexation/share gaps, and write failing or objective verification around the new SEO contract where practical
- [x] T4 Implement the `/site` SEO remediations, generate and open an HTML audit report with recommendations, and document the workflow
- [ ] T5 Run targeted verification for metadata/routes/build/report generation, then capture review notes and a second scoped commit for the SEO pass

### Review
- Added a shared SEO contract in [site/lib/seo.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/lib/seo.ts) and wired it into [site/app/layout.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/layout.tsx) so the marketing site now emits canonical metadata, Open Graph and Twitter cards, a manifest link, theme color, and JSON-LD for `WebSite`, `Organization`, and `SoftwareApplication`.
- Added crawl/share routes in [site/app/robots.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/robots.ts), [site/app/sitemap.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/sitemap.ts), [site/app/manifest.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/manifest.ts), [site/app/opengraph-image.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/opengraph-image.tsx), and [site/app/twitter-image.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/twitter-image.tsx), plus link-hardening and semantic-nav updates in the landing-page sections so the single-page site has first-party crawl and share surfaces.
- Added regression coverage in [site/lib/seo.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/lib/seo.test.ts) and updated [vitest.config.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/vitest.config.ts) so site-level SEO tests are included in the repo’s normal Vitest suite.
- Added [site_seo_audit.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/site_seo_audit.py), which audits either a live site URL or the built Next artifacts under `site/.next-build/server/app`, then writes the branded HTML report at [site-seo-audit-2026-03-11.html](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/reports/site-seo-audit-2026-03-11.html).
- Updated [site/README.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/README.md) and [README.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/README.md) so the production-site URL requirement, crawl/share routes, and audit workflow are documented for both live-URL and build-artifact verification.
- Verified `npx vitest run site/lib/seo.test.ts`, `cd site && npm run lint`, `cd site && NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-build npx next build --webpack`, `python3 -m py_compile scripts/site_seo_audit.py`, and `python3 scripts/site_seo_audit.py --build-dir site/.next-build/server/app`, with the final audit reporting `18 pass, 0 warn, 0 fail`.
- Attempted to stage and commit the scoped site batch, but this session cannot write inside `.git/` (`fatal: Unable to create '.git/index.lock': Operation not permitted`), so the commit itself remains blocked outside the repo content changes.

## Session: RVOL Docs, Commit Checkpoint, And Fullscreen Toggle (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Audit the current RVOL-fix worktree, documentation update targets, and the shell/header implementation that owns the theme selector) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the docs + commit + fullscreen plan in `tasks/todo.md`) depends_on: [T1]

- T6 (Run targeted verification for docs/build/tests/browser behavior, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T5]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Audit the current RVOL-fix worktree, documentation update targets, and the shell/header implementation that owns the theme selector
- [x] T2 Record the docs + commit + fullscreen plan in `tasks/todo.md`
- [x] T3 Update the relevant docs for the RVOL cache/backfill fix and create a scoped commit for the CRI/RVOL work

### Review
- Updated the CRI/regime docs in [README.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/README.md), [docs/strategies.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/docs/strategies.md), and [docs/status.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/docs/status.md) to describe the richer CRI cache selection, 20-session RVOL backfill behavior, and the post-close cache refresh path.
- Committed the scoped RVOL/cache/docs checkpoint as `27e78a7` (`fix: restore regime rvol history from cri cache`) without pulling in the unrelated site/worktree changes that were already present in the repo.
- Added the fullscreen control in [Header.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/Header.tsx) and [WorkspaceShell.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/WorkspaceShell.tsx), using `Maximize2` / `Minimize2` icons and a document-level Escape handler that exits fullscreen when the app is expanded.
- Kept the existing theme button uniquely targetable by moving the new control onto its own `.fullscreen-toggle` class and sharing the button styling in [globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css).
- Added fullscreen regressions in [header-fullscreen-control.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/header-fullscreen-control.test.ts) and [header-fullscreen.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/header-fullscreen.spec.ts).
- Verified `pytest scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py -q`, `npx vitest run web/tests/cri-cache-selection.test.ts web/tests/regime-history-backfill.test.ts web/tests/regime-route-cache-selection.test.ts web/tests/header-fullscreen-control.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-rvol-history.spec.ts e2e/regime-rvol-history-live-route.spec.ts e2e/header-fullscreen.spec.ts`, `bash -n scripts/run_cri_scan.sh && bash -n scripts/run_data_refresh.sh`, and `cd web && npm run build`.
- Additional sanity check: the theme-toggle-only cases in [price-chart-theme.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/price-chart-theme.spec.ts) still pass. Two older modal-opening cases in that same spec are still failing because the stubbed AAPL ticker-detail modal never appears; that failure is outside the fullscreen path and was not part of this task.

## Session: Regime RVOL History Cache Fix (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Audit the `/regime` RVOL/COR1M chart data flow, existing CRI cache artifacts, and the post-close sync hooks) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the RVOL history cache fix plan in `tasks/todo.md`) depends_on: [T1]

- T6 (Capture review notes and verification results for the RVOL history fix) depends_on: [T5]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Audit the `/regime` RVOL/COR1M chart data flow, existing CRI cache artifacts, and the post-close sync hooks
- [x] T2 Record the RVOL history cache fix plan in `tasks/todo.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression tests for RVOL history backfill, cache normalization, and `/regime` browser rendering

- [x] T5 Run targeted verification with Python tests, web tests, and Playwright E2E
- [x] T6 Capture review notes and verification results for the RVOL history fix

### Review
- Expanded the CRI payload in [scripts/cri_scan.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/cri_scan.py) so cached `spy_closes` now preserve the trailing 40 daily closes, which is enough to reconstruct realized-vol values for the full 20-session chart instead of only today’s point.
- Added [regimeHistory.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/regimeHistory.ts) and wired it into [route.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/api/regime/route.ts) so `/api/regime` backfills missing `history[].realized_vol` values from cached SPY closes before the page renders the RVOL/COR1M chart.
- Updated the post-close path in [run_data_refresh.sh](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/run_data_refresh.sh) so the daily sync refreshes `data/cri.json` and writes a new scheduled CRI snapshot after 4:00 PM ET whenever the current cache is missing a complete 20-session RVOL history.
- Added regressions in [test_cri_scan.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py), [regime-history-backfill.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-history-backfill.test.ts), and [regime-rvol-history.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-rvol-history.spec.ts) to lock the cache contract, API repair path, and live-route browser rendering.
- Verified `pytest scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py -q`, `npx tsx --test web/tests/regime-history-backfill.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-rvol-history.spec.ts`, `bash -n scripts/run_data_refresh.sh`, and `cd web && npm run build`.

## Session: Site Landing Page Phase 4 Implementation (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Audit the current `/site` implementation, package setup, and brand constraints for the landing-page refactor) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the Phase 4 implementation plan in `tasks/todo.md`) depends_on: [T1]

- T4 (Replace the existing homepage with the new institutional-terminal landing page and supporting content/data) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Verify the redesigned `/site` with build and browser automation, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Audit the current `/site` implementation, package setup, and brand constraints for the landing-page refactor
- [x] T2 Record the Phase 4 implementation plan in `tasks/todo.md`
- [x] T3 Refactor `/site` into Radon-native atoms, molecules, organisms, and section components
- [x] T4 Replace the existing homepage with the new institutional-terminal landing page and supporting content/data
- [x] T5 Verify the redesigned `/site` with build and browser automation, then capture review notes

### Review
- Replaced the old monolithic homepage with a section-composed landing page in [site/app/page.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/page.tsx) and a reusable `/site/components` architecture built around Radon-native atoms, molecules, organisms, and sections.
- The redesign now centers the product on strategies, execution, and state reconstruction, with dedicated sections for the strategy matrix, execution rail, surface preview, auditability layer, and final operator CTA.
- Preserved Radon’s enforced design system in [site/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/globals.css) and the section/component primitives: dark-first surfaces, teal `signal.core`, hairline borders, tight panel geometry, mono telemetry, and depth via layered surfaces instead of soft shadows or glassmorphism.
- Consolidated the richer landing-page content model in [site/lib/landing-content.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/lib/landing-content.ts) and reconciled mixed worktree component contracts so the active section tree compiles cleanly against a single data shape.
- Updated [site/.gitignore](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/.gitignore) to ignore `.next-build/` and `.next-dev-webpack/`, so the alternate build paths used for verification do not leave untracked noise in the worktree.
- Verified `cd site && npm run lint` passes.
- Verified `cd site && NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-build npm run build` passes, using an alternate `distDir` to avoid a live `.next` lock held by another local Next process.
- Added [site/next.config.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/next.config.ts) support for environment-scoped `distDir` values and an explicit Turbopack root so site verification can run without colliding with other local site processes.
- Verified live browser rendering on a dedicated webpack dev server with `cd site && NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-dev-webpack npx next dev -p 3335 --webpack`.
- Verified browser automation from the repo’s Playwright install against `http://127.0.0.1:3335`, asserting the hero, strategy, execution, and audit sections and capturing `/tmp/radon-site-phase4.png`.


## Session: Performance Card Explainability Modals (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the current `/performance` panel and the existing clickable metric-card pattern used on `/portfolio`) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the implementation plan for clickable performance cards in `tasks/todo.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing browser or route coverage for clickable performance cards and their explanatory modal content) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement clickable cards and explanatory modal content across the `/performance` page) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted verification with Playwright browser automation and supporting tests) depends_on: [T4]
- T6 (Capture review notes and summarize the final behavior) depends_on: [T5]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current `/performance` panel and the existing clickable metric-card pattern used on `/portfolio`
- [x] T2 Record the implementation plan for clickable performance cards in `tasks/todo.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing browser or route coverage for clickable performance cards and their explanatory modal content
- [x] T4 Implement clickable cards and explanatory modal content across the `/performance` page
- [x] T5 Run targeted verification with Playwright browser automation and supporting tests
- [x] T6 Capture review notes and summarize the final behavior

### Review
- Scoped the clickable behavior to the eight actual `StatCard` metric cards in the Core Performance section of [PerformancePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/PerformancePanel.tsx), which matches the existing `/portfolio` interaction pattern without turning non-card list rows into fake cards.
- Added [MetricDefinitionModal.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/MetricDefinitionModal.tsx) so each performance card can explain both what the metric means and how it is calculated, instead of only showing a formula string.
- Converted all eight core performance cards into accessible button-style metric cards with `metric-card-clickable`, stable `data-testid` values, and per-metric definition/formula content wired from the reconstructed performance payload.
- Added browser coverage in [performance-page.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/performance-page.spec.ts) to prove the cards are clickable and that representative cards open the expected explainability modal content.
- Verified `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/performance-page.spec.ts --grep "performance metric cards are clickable"`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/performance-page.spec.ts`, and `cd web && npm run build`.

## Session: Performance Net Liq Reconciliation Fix (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the current performance reconstruction engine, API freshness behavior, and existing tests to define exact failing cases) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the implementation plan for the reconciliation fix in `tasks/todo.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression tests for Flex trade-date normalization, ending-equity anchoring, and stale `/api/performance` behavior) depends_on: [T1, T2]

- T5 (Add or update browser coverage for the user-visible reconciliation behavior on `/performance`) depends_on: [T4]
- T6 (Run targeted verification, capture review notes, and summarize the root-cause fix) depends_on: [T4, T5]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current performance reconstruction engine, API freshness behavior, and existing tests to define exact failing cases
- [x] T2 Record the implementation plan for the reconciliation fix in `tasks/todo.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression tests for Flex trade-date normalization, ending-equity anchoring, and stale `/api/performance` behavior
- [x] T4 Implement Python and route fixes so `/performance` reconciles to the current portfolio net liquidation snapshot
- [x] T5 Add or update browser coverage for the user-visible reconciliation behavior on `/performance`
- [x] T6 Run targeted verification, capture review notes, and summarize the root-cause fix

### Review
- Fixed the core reconstruction bug in [scripts/portfolio_performance.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/portfolio_performance.py) by normalizing trade dates before parsing and replay, so raw Flex `YYYYMMDD` dates now align with the `YYYY-MM-DD` benchmark calendar used for the YTD curve.
- Hardened the performance payload builder so option-history fetch failures no longer abort the entire sync; missing option marks are downgraded to warnings plus `contracts_missing_history`, allowing the ending equity to stay anchored to the current account snapshot.
- Updated [web/app/api/performance/route.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/api/performance/route.ts) so the route detects when cached performance is behind the current portfolio snapshot and refreshes the persisted payload before serving it, with cached fallback if the sync fails.
- Expanded [scripts/tests/test_portfolio_performance.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/tests/test_portfolio_performance.py), [web/tests/performance-route.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/performance-route.test.ts), and [web/e2e/performance-page.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/performance-page.spec.ts) to cover compact Flex dates, stale cache refresh, and the browser-visible ending-equity reconciliation behavior.
- Verified the live reconstruction path after the fix: `python3 scripts/portfolio_performance.py --json` completed successfully and matched `data/portfolio.json` exactly with `ending_equity == account_summary.net_liquidation == 1308382.19`.

## Session: Performance YTD Reconciliation Investigation (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the performance engine, web route, and portfolio net liquidation source to map the current YTD calculation flow) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the investigation plan and the user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Compare the live or cached `/performance` and `/portfolio` payloads to locate the source of the mismatch) depends_on: [T1]
- T4 (Explain the exact YTD methodology and identify the most likely root cause of the discrepancy) depends_on: [T2, T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the performance engine, web route, and portfolio net liquidation source to map the current YTD calculation flow
- [x] T2 Record the investigation plan and the user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Compare the live or cached `/performance` and `/portfolio` payloads to locate the source of the mismatch
- [x] T4 Explain the exact YTD methodology and identify the most likely root cause of the discrepancy

### Review
- Confirmed the `/performance` page is a reconstructed close-to-close YTD curve built from trade cash flows plus daily marks, not a live account-equity history.
- Confirmed the `/portfolio` page reads `data/portfolio.json` with a 60-second stale window, while `/performance` reads `data/performance.json` with a 15-minute stale window and serves the old cache immediately while refreshing in the background.
- Observed a live mismatch between the two payloads during the investigation: `/api/performance` was still serving `as_of: 2026-03-10` with `ending_equity: 1063031.8637`, while `/api/portfolio` was serving `last_sync: 2026-03-11T06:37:14.669874` with `account_summary.net_liquidation: 1313112.03`.
- Running `scripts/portfolio_performance.py --json` against the current portfolio snapshot still produced a mismatched ending equity, which shows the issue is not only cache staleness.
- The most likely engine bug is trade-date normalization in `parse_flex_trade_rows()`: Flex trade dates are being consumed as `YYYYMMDD`, while the benchmark calendar uses `YYYY-MM-DD`. That breaks the day matching inside `reconstruct_equity_curve()` and can prevent fills from ever being applied on the intended dates.
- A second degradation path is active as well: when IB Flex is rate-limited, the script falls back to `data/blotter.json`, which can lag the current portfolio and therefore cannot reliably explain the live holdings on `/portfolio`.

## Session: Codex Skill YAML Fixes (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the affected `SKILL.md` files under `~/.codex/skills` and identify the invalid YAML frontmatter) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the task plan and the user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Patch the invalid `description` frontmatter fields so each skill manifest uses a string, not a sequence) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Validate both skill manifests with a direct YAML/frontmatter parse check) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Capture review notes and summarize which files were fixed) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the affected `SKILL.md` files under `~/.codex/skills` and identify the invalid YAML frontmatter
- [x] T2 Record the task plan and the user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Patch the invalid `description` frontmatter fields so each skill manifest uses a string, not a sequence
- [x] T4 Validate both skill manifests with a direct YAML/frontmatter parse check
- [x] T5 Capture review notes and summarize which files were fixed

### Review
- Inspected both reported skill manifests under `~/.codex/skills` and confirmed only `metal-macos-replatform/SKILL.md` was malformed; `metal-macos/SKILL.md` already had a valid string-valued `description`.
- The root cause was YAML frontmatter using bracketed placeholder text after `description:` in `metal-macos-replatform/SKILL.md`, which YAML parses as a sequence instead of the string type expected by the Codex skill loader.
- Rewrote that `description` field as a plain string while keeping the skill intent intact.
- Validated both manifests with a direct frontmatter parse check using `yaml.safe_load`, confirming `description` resolves to `str` for both files.
- Result: the repeated "invalid YAML: description: invalid type: sequence, expected a string" loader warning should stop on the next skill discovery/load cycle.

## Session: Performance Page Explainer Report (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Audit the live `/performance` page and backend metric engine to enumerate every rendered item) depends_on: []
- T2 (Document the plan and output requirements for the HTML explainer report) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Implement a generated HTML report that maps every displayed metric to its value, formula, and definition) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Validate the report against current `data/performance.json` or live `/api/performance`, then open it locally) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Capture review notes and final output path in the task log) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Audit the live `/performance` page and backend metric engine to enumerate every rendered item
- [x] T2 Document the plan and output requirements for the HTML explainer report
- [x] T3 Implement a generated HTML report that maps every displayed metric to its value, formula, and definition
- [x] T4 Validate the report against current `data/performance.json` or live `/api/performance`, then open it locally
- [x] T5 Capture review notes and final output path in the task log

### Review
- Added [performance_explainer_report.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/performance_explainer_report.py), a reusable generator that reads the current `data/performance.json` payload and emits a standalone HTML explainer for every currently visible `/performance` item.
- The report covers the hero banner, source/drawdown pills, all eight core performance cards, the chart header/legend/meta block, all tail/path-risk items, all distribution/capture items, methodology provenance, and each warning flag.
- Each row in the report includes the page item's current display, the exact formula or provenance used to render it, and a plain-English institutional definition.
- Generated output at [performance-page-explainer-2026-03-11.html](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/reports/performance-page-explainer-2026-03-11.html) and opened it locally with the standard browser-open flow.
- Verified the file exists, has content, and includes the expected sections: Hero Banner, Core Performance, Tail And Path Risk, Methodology, and Warnings.

## Session: Portfolio Performance Route (2026-03-10)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Audit existing portfolio, blotter, benchmark, and web route plumbing for a new performance surface) depends_on: []

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Audit existing portfolio, blotter, benchmark, and web route plumbing for a new performance surface
- [x] T2 Define YTD performance methodology, institutional metric set, and library strategy from primary-source research
- [x] T3 Add backend/unit tests for trade parsing, curve reconstruction, and metric calculations
- [x] T4 Implement Python performance engine, cache artifact, and benchmark/price fetch path
- [x] T5 Expose performance data through a new web API contract and shared types

- [x] T7 Add browser coverage for the new page and confirm rendered metrics against the API contract
- [x] T8 Run verification, update relevant docs, and capture review notes/risks

### Review
- Reused and completed the in-repo `scripts/portfolio_performance.py` engine instead of adding a new analytics dependency. The metric formulas stay local, align to `empyrical` / `quantstats` conventions, and compute a reconstructed YTD equity curve from IB Flex executions plus historical marks.
- Added focused backend coverage in `scripts/tests/test_portfolio_performance.py` for OCC-style option ID formatting, option mark selection, curve replay, core institutional metrics, and the top-level payload contract that feeds the web route.
- Refreshed `data/performance.json` from the live script so the existing `/api/performance` cache and the new UI load the same contract.
- Wired the new `performance` workspace section into the Next.js terminal, added a dedicated `PerformancePanel`, and surfaced the institutional metrics stack: YTD return, ending equity, Sharpe, Sortino, max drawdown, beta, alpha, information ratio, VaR/CVaR, charted YTD equity vs benchmark, and methodology/warning panels.
- Added targeted route metadata coverage in `web/tests/chat.test.ts`, `web/tests/data.test.ts`, and `web/tests/performance-route.test.ts`, plus mocked browser automation in `web/e2e/performance-page.spec.ts`.
- Caught and fixed a payload-contract bug during final verification: `summary.trading_days` was being overwritten by return-count metrics. The payload now reports full YTD session count, and the refreshed cache plus live `/api/performance` route both return `46` series points with `46` trading days.
- Verified `pytest scripts/tests/test_portfolio_performance.py -q`, `npx vitest run web/tests/chat.test.ts web/tests/data.test.ts web/tests/performance-route.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/performance-page.spec.ts`, and `cd web && npm run build`.
- Residual risk: the reconstructed curve is anchored to current net liquidation and assumes no unmodeled external cash flows inside the observed window; that caveat is exposed directly in the API warnings and rendered on the page.

## Session: Vercel Site Build Gate (2026-03-10)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect current repo/Vercel configuration and confirm the site app deployment root assumptions) depends_on: []
- T2 (Add a repo-side Vercel ignored-build rule so the site deploy only runs when `/site` changes) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Document the site deployment gating behavior in the relevant README files) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted validation for the ignore-step script and prepare a scoped commit/push) depends_on: [T2, T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect current repo/Vercel configuration and confirm the site app deployment root assumptions
- [x] T2 Add a repo-side Vercel ignored-build rule so the site deploy only runs when `/site` changes
- [x] T3 Document the site deployment gating behavior in the relevant README files
- [x] T4 Run targeted validation for the ignore-step script and prepare a scoped commit/push

### Review
- Added [site/vercel.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/vercel.json) with a Vercel `ignoreCommand` and implemented the git-diff gate in [vercel-ignore-build.mjs](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/scripts/vercel-ignore-build.mjs).
- The ignore-step script now only skips the deploy when it can prove there were no changes under `site/`; if the previous SHA or diff lookup is unavailable, it continues the build instead of risking a false skip.
- Documented the deployment behavior in [site/README.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/README.md) and the repo-level [README.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/README.md), including the requirement that the Vercel project Root Directory be `site/`.
- Verified the ignore-step locally from both the site root and repo root with identical SHAs: `node scripts/vercel-ignore-build.mjs` and `node site/scripts/vercel-ignore-build.mjs` both exited `0` and reported that the build would be skipped.

## Session: COR1M Current Value Fix (2026-03-10)

### Dependency Graph

- T2 (Add failing backend and browser regressions for COR1M current-value sourcing) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Implement CRI scan fix so COR1M current value comes from quote metadata/current quote, not the daily-bar close) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Refresh CRI cache artifacts and align any affected generated files) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted verification and capture review notes) depends_on: [T3, T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Audit current COR1M sourcing, cache flow, and UI expectations for the mismatch
- [x] T2 Add failing backend and browser regressions for COR1M current-value sourcing
- [x] T3 Implement CRI scan fix so COR1M current value comes from quote metadata/current quote, not the daily-bar close
- [x] T4 Refresh CRI cache artifacts and align any affected generated files
- [x] T5 Run targeted verification and capture review notes

### Review
- Confirmed red phase: `pytest scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py -q` failed on the new `current_override` and `current_quotes` expectations before the fix.
- Backend fix now separates COR1M current-level sourcing from historical bars: `run_analysis()` accepts `current_quotes`, `cor1m_level_and_change()` supports a current override, and the last history row is patched to the selected current quote.
- Added current-quote source selection for COR1M in `scripts/cri_scan.py`: prefer IB current quote when available, compare against Yahoo chart metadata, and fall back to Yahoo when IB diverges materially or is unavailable.
- Refreshed the served CRI artifacts by correcting [data/cri.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/data/cri.json) and writing a clean latest scheduled snapshot at [cri-2026-03-10T18-45.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/data/cri_scheduled/cri-2026-03-10T18-45.json).
- Verified `pytest scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py -q` passes with `59/59`.
- Verified `npx playwright test e2e/regime-cor1m.spec.ts e2e/regime-cor1m-live-route.spec.ts` passes with `3/3`, including an unmocked `/regime` browser check against the live route.
- Verified the running dev server returns the corrected payload via `http://localhost:3000/api/regime`: `cor1m: 28.97`, `cor1m_5d_change: 6.88`, `cri.score: 25.4`.

- [x] T6 Update all relevant docs, strategy references, site copy, and command/help surfaces
- [x] T7 Run verification, capture review notes, and summarize residual risks

### Review
- Confirmed red/green TDD: `pytest scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py -q` failed on missing `cor1m_level_and_change`, then passed with 51/51 after the refactor.
- Confirmed browser automation against the running dev server: `npx playwright test e2e/regime-cor1m.spec.ts e2e/regime-market-closed-eod.spec.ts` passed with 9/9.
- Confirmed targeted `/regime` source-inspection tests pass after updating them to ESM-safe path handling: `npx tsx --test tests/regime-market-closed-values.test.ts tests/regime-market-closed.test.ts tests/regime-spy-subscription.test.ts`.
- Confirmed `cd web && npm run build` passes after the COR1M subscription and UI contract changes.
- Refreshed CRI cache artifacts with live COR1M data: `python3 scripts/cri_scan.py --json > data/cri.json` and wrote `data/cri_scheduled/cri-2026-03-10T17-21.json`.
- Residual risk: older scheduled CRI cache files still exist historically in `data/cri_scheduled/`; the app now has a fresh COR1M-shaped file, so current reads are correct.

## Session: Real-Time Option Contract Price Subscriptions (2026-03-03)

### Problem
IB realtime WS server only subscribed to stock contracts (`ib.contract.stock()`), so options positions (bear put spreads, bull call spreads, short puts) never received real-time price updates.

### Solution
Composite key scheme: stock prices keyed by ticker (`"AAPL"`), option prices by `{SYMBOL}_{YYYYMMDD}_{STRIKE}_{RIGHT}` (e.g., `"EWY_20260417_42_P"`). Both coexist in the same `Record<string, PriceData>` map.

### Checklist
- [x] Add shared types & utilities (`web/lib/pricesProtocol.ts`): `OptionContract`, `optionKey()`, `contractsKey()`, `portfolioLegToContract()`
- [x] Update IB server (`scripts/ib_realtime_server.js`): `normalizeContracts()`, refactored `startLiveSubscription(key, ibContract)`, option subscribe handler via `ib.contract.option()`
- [x] Update client hook (`web/lib/usePrices.ts`): `contracts` option, `contractHash` memoization, contracts in subscribe message
- [x] Extract contracts from portfolio (`web/components/WorkspaceShell.tsx`): `portfolioContracts` useMemo iterates non-Stock legs
- [x] Display real-time option prices (`web/components/WorkspaceSections.tsx`): `legPriceKey()`, real-time MV/daily-change for options, `LegRow` with WS prices

### Files Modified
- `web/lib/pricesProtocol.ts`
- `scripts/ib_realtime_server.js`
- `web/lib/usePrices.ts`
- `web/components/WorkspaceShell.tsx`
- `web/components/WorkspaceSections.tsx`

### Review
- TypeScript compilation passes (no errors in modified files)
- Server syntax check passes (`node --check`)
- Backward compatible: stock subscriptions unchanged, option contracts are additive

## Session: Remote IBC Control + Cloud Hosting Research (2026-03-10)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Capture current local IBC architecture and control points) depends_on: []
- T2 (Research secure remote-control options for local IBC from iPhone) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Research cloud-hosted IBC deployment options and constraints) depends_on: [T1]
- T4 (Compare options and select recommendation ordering) depends_on: [T2, T3]
- T5 (Document implementation plan and review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Capture current local IBC architecture and control points
- [x] T2 Research secure remote-control options for local IBC from iPhone
- [x] T3 Research cloud-hosted IBC deployment options and constraints
- [x] T4 Compare options and select recommendation ordering
- [x] T5 Document implementation plan and review notes

### Review
- Verified the active local service is the machine-global `local.ibc-gateway` LaunchAgent, not the legacy repo-local `com.radon.ibc-gateway` path.
- Verified live control wrappers exist at `~/ibc/bin/start-secure-ibc-service.sh`, `stop-secure-ibc-service.sh`, `restart-secure-ibc-service.sh`, and `status-secure-ibc-service.sh`; each is a thin `launchctl` wrapper against `gui/$UID/local.ibc-gateway`.
- Verified the active runner `~/ibc/bin/run-secure-ibc-gateway.sh` loads credentials from macOS Keychain, writes a temporary `0600` runtime IBC config, and launches `ibcstart.sh` in Gateway mode.
- Best local remote-control recommendation: keep IBC on the Mac, add a private control plane over Tailscale, and trigger only the existing wrapper scripts remotely. Best UX variant is a small status/start/stop web endpoint exposed via Tailscale Serve and locked to the tailnet; lowest-effort variant is SSH over Tailscale from iPhone.
- Best cloud recommendation: move to a dedicated private Linux VM running IB Gateway + IBC, accessed only over VPN/private network. This remains operationally viable but outside IBKR's supported headless model, so weekly Sunday re-auth and strict network isolation remain mandatory.
- Secondary cloud options: QuantRocket if a broader managed IB stack is desirable; community Docker images only for operators already comfortable with containers, persistence, and private networking.

## Session: Phase 1 Remote IBC Access Implementation (2026-03-10)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect current Tailscale, SSH, and IBC control state on the Mac) depends_on: []
- T2 (Implement repo-local Phase 1 helper tooling around the existing secure IBC wrappers) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Persist future-facing markdown documentation referencing the HTML report) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Validate helper behavior and capture remaining manual system steps) depends_on: [T2, T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect current Tailscale, SSH, and IBC control state on the Mac
- [x] T2 Implement repo-local Phase 1 helper tooling around the existing secure IBC wrappers
- [x] T3 Persist future-facing markdown documentation referencing the HTML report
- [x] T4 Validate helper behavior and capture remaining manual system steps

### Review
- Verified the current Phase 1 shape uses standard macOS SSH over the Tailscale network, not Tailscale SSH server mode, because this Mac has the GUI app variant of Tailscale installed.
- Verified the canonical IBC service surface is the secure machine-local wrapper set in `~/ibc/bin/`; repo automation is documented as a convenience wrapper only.
- Added `scripts/ibc_remote_control.sh` as a repo-local helper for `check`, `tailscale-status`, `tailscale-login`, `ibc-status`, `ibc-start`, `ibc-stop`, `ibc-restart`, and `remote-help`.
- Added `docs/ibc-remote-access.md` as the durable markdown reference and linked it to `reports/ibc-remote-control-and-cloud-options-2026-03-10.html`.
- Added `tasks/lessons.md` to capture the correction that the secure machine-local `~/ibc/bin/*secure-ibc-service.sh` commands are the canonical service surface.
- Validation:
  - `./scripts/ibc_remote_control.sh check` confirmed Tailscale is connected, macOS SSH is enabled, and `local.ibc-gateway` is running.
  - `./scripts/ibc_remote_control.sh ibc-status` confirmed the secure `local.ibc-gateway` LaunchAgent is running.
  - `./scripts/ibc_remote_control.sh remote-help` prints both direct secure-service SSH commands and the optional repo convenience wrapper commands.
  - `nc -zv 127.0.0.1 22` confirmed the SSH listener is active.
  - Public-key SSH is not configured yet because `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` is absent; Phase 1 will therefore be password-based from the iPhone unless a client key is added later.
- Remaining optional step:
  - Add a dedicated SSH public key for the iPhone client if you want key-based login instead of password auth.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inventory current Phase 1 files and documentation touchpoints) depends_on: []
- T2 (Update canonical docs with the working SSH-over-Tailscale flow and dependencies) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Validate docs and helper behavior against the live machine state) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Commit only the relevant files) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Push the commit to the current branch remote) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist

- [x] T3 Validate docs and helper behavior against the live machine state
- [x] T4 Commit only the relevant files
- [x] T5 Push the commit to the current branch remote

### Review
- Reworked `README.md` to match the requested structure from the shared review: cleaner summary, badges, explicit Inputs/Processing/Outputs, three-gate framework, strategy matrix, architecture diagram, grouped commands, simplified data-source/testing sections, example workflow, and the Phase 1 remote IBC dependency block.
- Updated the authoritative IBC docs in `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/implement.md`, and `docs/ib_tws_api.md` so the secure machine-local `~/ibc/bin/*secure-ibc-service.sh` commands are the primary surface and the old `scripts/setup_ibc.sh` flow is clearly legacy.
- Preserved and linked the Phase 1 remote-access runbook in `docs/ibc-remote-access.md`, including the concrete dependencies required for iPhone control:
  - `Tailscale.app` on the Mac
  - Tailscale on the iPhone, connected to the same tailnet
  - macOS `Remote Login`
  - iPhone SSH client such as Termius, Blink Shell, or Prompt
  - Optional SSH public key in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` for key-based login
- Validation:
  - `bash -n scripts/ibc_remote_control.sh` passed.
  - `./scripts/ibc_remote_control.sh remote-help` prints the direct secure-service SSH commands and optional helper commands.
  - User confirmed iPhone SSH login works in Termius with password auth.
  - Commit: `bf86cc4` (`docs: refresh README and document secure IBC remote access`)
  - Push: `origin/main` updated on `2026-03-10`

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Compare README against the shared rewrite outline and current repo reality
- [x] T2 Rewrite README structure and preserve the secure IBC Phase 1 dependencies
- [x] T3 Verify the refreshed README still points to the durable runbook and report artifacts

### Review
- Reworked `README.md` around a clearer public-facing hierarchy: summary, What Radon Does, trade validation framework, strategies, architecture, quick start, terminal, grouped commands, project structure, data sources, testing, and services.
- Preserved the Phase 1 secure local IBC path in the README Services section, including the concrete dependencies for Tailscale, macOS Remote Login, and iPhone SSH clients.
- Added direct references from the README to the durable markdown runbook `docs/ibc-remote-access.md` and the preserved HTML report `reports/ibc-remote-control-and-cloud-options-2026-03-10.html`.
- Verification:
  - `rg -n "What Radon Does|Trade Validation Framework|System Architecture|Quick Start|Radon Terminal|CLI Commands|Phase 1 Remote IBC Access" README.md`
  - Manual README review against the shared outline confirmed the requested structural sections are present.

- T7 (Validate cloud persistence, secrets, restart behavior, and Sunday re-auth runbook) depends_on: [T6]
- T8 (Decide primary operating model and cut over to the preferred steady-state path) depends_on: [T5, T7]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Preserve the research baseline, report, and canonical secure local service surface
  - Success criteria:
    - `reports/ibc-remote-control-and-cloud-options-2026-03-10.html` remains the durable comparison artifact.
    - The canonical service surface is documented everywhere as `~/ibc/bin/*secure-ibc-service.sh`.
- [x] T2 Complete Phase 1 local SSH-over-Tailscale access and documentation
  - Success criteria:
    - iPhone can connect to the Mac over Tailscale and run the secure IBC commands.
    - README and runbook document the dependencies and direct command flow.
- [ ] T3 Harden local remote access with key-based SSH and tighter SSH policy
  - depends_on: [T2]
  - Success criteria:
    - iPhone SSH client uses a dedicated key instead of password auth.
    - `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` contains the intended client key only.
    - SSH config is reviewed so remote access remains limited to the Tailscale path and expected auth methods.
- [ ] T4 Build Phase 2 private web controller over Tailscale for start/stop/status/restart
  - depends_on: [T2]
  - Success criteria:
    - A minimal private controller runs only on the Mac.
    - It exposes `status`, `start`, `stop`, and `restart` for the secure local IBC service.
    - Access is restricted to the tailnet and does not expose IB API or IBC command ports publicly.
- [ ] T5 Add local resilience: health checks, alerting, and away-from-desk power/sleep policy
  - depends_on: [T3, T4]
  - Success criteria:
    - There is an operator-visible health signal for IBC reachability and launchd state.
    - Failure notifications or a simple alert path exist for the local service.
    - The machine’s sleep/power behavior is documented so remote control is reliable while away.
- [ ] T6 Stand up a private cloud IBC proof of concept on a Linux VM
  - depends_on: [T1]
  - Success criteria:
    - A private Linux VM runs IB Gateway + IBC with no public IB or VNC exposure.
    - Access is limited to Tailscale or equivalent private networking.
    - Secrets and persistent Gateway state are stored outside ad hoc local files.
- [ ] T7 Validate cloud persistence, secrets, restart behavior, and Sunday re-auth runbook
  - depends_on: [T6]
  - Success criteria:
    - The VM survives restart/redeploy without losing required Gateway/IBC state.
    - Weekly Sunday re-auth and recovery steps are documented and tested.
    - Burn-in covers reconnects, restart cadence, and failure handling for at least one trading week.
- [ ] T8 Decide primary operating model and cut over to the preferred steady-state path
  - depends_on: [T5, T7]
  - Success criteria:
    - There is an explicit decision between Mac-hosted primary and cloud-hosted primary.
    - The non-primary path is documented as fallback.
    - Final operator runbooks point to one canonical daily-use workflow.

### Review
- This session converts the prior research into an explicit end-to-end rollout instead of stopping at Phase 1.
- Current completed state:
  - Phase 1 local SSH-over-Tailscale access is working from the iPhone.
  - The secure machine-local `~/ibc/bin/*secure-ibc-service.sh` wrappers are the canonical service surface.
  - The durable research and reference artifacts already exist in `reports/ibc-remote-control-and-cloud-options-2026-03-10.html` and `docs/ibc-remote-access.md`.
- Remaining delivery is now split cleanly into two tracks:
  - Local track: SSH hardening, private web control plane, operational resilience.
  - Cloud track: private VM proof of concept, burn-in, and cutover decision.

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Phase 2 local hardening: key-based SSH, access policy, and reachability decision) depends_on: []
- T2 (Phase 3 private tailnet web controller for status/start/stop/restart and health) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Phase 4 cloud pilot: private Linux VM running IB Gateway + IBC with persistent state and private access) depends_on: [T1]
- T4 (Phase 5 cloud burn-in: restart/reconnect validation, Sunday re-auth runbook, and monitoring) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Phase 6 deployment decision and cutover plan across local versus cloud primary) depends_on: [T2, T4]

### Checklist
- [ ] T1 Phase 2 local hardening: key-based SSH, access policy, and reachability decision
  - depends_on: []
  - Success criteria:
    - A dedicated iPhone SSH public key is installed in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
    - The preferred auth mode and remote-access policy are documented for the Mac.
    - A reachability policy is chosen and documented: keep-awake, wake relay, or accepted sleep limitation.

- [ ] T2 Phase 3 private tailnet web controller for status/start/stop/restart and health
  - depends_on: [T1]
  - Success criteria:
    - A private controller is reachable only from the tailnet.
    - The iPhone flow supports `status`, `start`, `stop`, and `restart` without shell interaction.
    - Basic health, recent logs, and failure feedback are visible remotely.

- [ ] T3 Phase 4 cloud pilot: private Linux VM running IB Gateway + IBC with persistent state and private access
  - depends_on: [T1]
  - Success criteria:
    - A private VM is provisioned with IB Gateway + IBC, Tailscale, persisted config/state, and secrets handling.
    - No IB API, IBC, VNC, or controller ports are exposed publicly.
    - Recovery access is defined for the VM when Gateway needs manual intervention.

- [ ] T4 Phase 5 cloud burn-in: restart/reconnect validation, Sunday re-auth runbook, and monitoring
  - depends_on: [T3]
  - Success criteria:
    - The cloud pilot survives a multi-day burn-in with successful reconnect behavior.
    - The Sunday re-auth and failure-recovery runbook is documented and validated.
    - Monitoring and log collection are sufficient to detect disconnects or stuck sessions.

- [ ] T5 Phase 6 deployment decision and cutover plan across local versus cloud primary
  - depends_on: [T2, T4]
  - Success criteria:
    - A primary deployment model is chosen: local Mac with private controller, cloud VM, or cloud pilot only.
    - Rollback and failover steps are documented for whichever model is selected.
    - The durable docs and future runbooks are updated to reflect the chosen operating model.

### Review
- Phase 1 is complete and operational: password-based macOS SSH over Tailscale to the secure `~/ibc/bin/*secure-ibc-service.sh` wrappers.
- The next local step is hardening, not replacing, the current path: add key-based SSH and make the Mac reachability policy explicit.
- The private web controller is the best Phase 3 UX improvement because it keeps the canonical service surface intact while removing the need for shell interaction on the phone.
- The cloud track should be treated as a pilot until a burn-in validates restart behavior, Sunday re-auth handling, and recovery procedures.
- If the cloud pilot remains operationally weaker than the local Mac because of IBKR auth friction, keep the local deployment as primary and treat cloud as a secondary or recovery path.
