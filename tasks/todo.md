## Session: Separate Quote-Level And Order-Level Spread Notional (2026-03-12)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the shared ticker-detail quote path and confirm which surfaces should use quote-level vs quantity-sized spread notional) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the corrected plan and user-correction lesson in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Update regression tests to encode quote-level spread on the shared ticker modal and quantity-sized spread on explicit order surfaces, then observe red) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement the minimal fix so `TickerDetailModal` uses quote-level spread notional while `InstrumentDetailModal` and `ModifyOrderModal` stay quantity-aware) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the shared ticker-detail quote path and confirm which surfaces should use quote-level vs quantity-sized spread notional
- [x] T2 Record the corrected plan and user-correction lesson in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Update regression tests to encode quote-level spread on the shared ticker modal and quantity-sized spread on explicit order surfaces, then observe red
- [x] T4 Implement the minimal fix so `TickerDetailModal` uses quote-level spread notional while `InstrumentDetailModal` and `ModifyOrderModal` stay quantity-aware
- [x] T5 Run targeted Vitest and Playwright verification, then capture review notes

### Review
- Root cause: the shared top quote bar in [web/components/TickerDetailModal.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/TickerDetailModal.tsx) was multiplying option spread width by `position.contracts`, even though that bar is shared across `Company`, `Position`, and `Order` tabs and does not own an explicit order quantity. That made general quote telemetry look like order-sized friction.
- Kept quantity-aware spread notional on the true order-sized surfaces: [web/components/InstrumentDetailModal.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/InstrumentDetailModal.tsx) still uses the displayed leg quantity, and [web/components/ModifyOrderModal.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/ModifyOrderModal.tsx) still uses `order.totalQuantity`.
- Added a focused regression in [web/tests/ticker-detail-spread-notional.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/ticker-detail-spread-notional.test.ts) plus browser coverage in [web/e2e/price-bar-quote-telemetry.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/price-bar-quote-telemetry.spec.ts) to lock the shared ticker modal to quote-level spread notional. The pre-fix red phase failed with `$2,200.00 / 240 bps` instead of `$110.00 / 240 bps`.
- Verified green with `npx vitest run web/tests/ticker-detail-spread-notional.test.ts web/tests/order-ticket-spread-notional.test.ts web/tests/instrument-detail-spread-quantity.test.ts web/tests/price-bar-quote-telemetry.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/price-bar-quote-telemetry.spec.ts e2e/order-ticket-quote-telemetry.spec.ts --config playwright.config.ts`.

## Session: Document And Ship Site Surface Fix (2026-03-11)

- T2 (Update the relevant docs and record the ship plan in `tasks/todo.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Stage only the `/site` bug-fix, doc, and task-log files for this batch) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Create a scoped commit for the standalone-site surface fix and verification updates) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current `/site` fix worktree and identify the minimal doc touchpoints that should be updated before shipping
- [x] T2 Update the relevant docs and record the ship plan in `tasks/todo.md`
- [x] T3 Stage only the `/site` bug-fix, doc, and task-log files for this batch
- [x] T4 Create a scoped commit for the standalone-site surface fix and verification updates
- [x] T5 Push the current branch and capture the shipping review note

### Review
- Shipped only the standalone-site surface fix batch: the compact preview-card metric treatment, the restored header theme toggle, the new browser regression for the surface-preview divider spacing, the small branding-spec lint cleanup, the site verification docs update, and the task log / lesson updates.
- Commit and push completed on `main` after the green standalone-site verification set: `cd web && npx playwright test branding.spec.ts theme-toggle.spec.ts surface-preview.spec.ts --config playwright.site.config.ts`, `cd site && npm run lint`, and `cd site && NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-build npm run build`.

## Session: Site Surface Metric Overflow Fix (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the `/site` surface-preview section and identify why the performance metric value bleeds into the adjacent tile at desktop width) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the bug-fix plan in `tasks/todo.md` and capture the user-correction lesson in `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage for the overflowing metric tile on the standalone site) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement the minimal layout fix in the shared site metric/tile components without regressing the existing brand treatment) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted verification, update review notes, and confirm the preview cards stay contained on desktop widths) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the `/site` surface-preview section and identify why the performance metric value bleeds into the adjacent tile at desktop width
- [x] T2 Record the bug-fix plan in `tasks/todo.md` and capture the user-correction lesson in `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for the overflowing metric tile on the standalone site
- [x] T4 Implement the minimal layout fix in the shared site metric/tile components without regressing the existing brand treatment
- [x] T5 Run targeted verification, update review notes, and confirm the preview cards stay contained on desktop widths

### Review
- Root cause: the `/site` surface-preview cards render split metric tiles through [site/components/organisms/SurfacePanelStack.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/components/organisms/SurfacePanelStack.tsx), but the shared mono metric in [site/components/atoms/MonoMetric.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/components/atoms/MonoMetric.tsx) used the same large value treatment as wider hero cards, leaving the `Institutional` value visually too tight to the divider in the narrower two-column tile layout.
- Added a failing browser regression in [site/e2e/surface-preview.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/e2e/surface-preview.spec.ts) that measures the rendered value against the adjacent tile at desktop width; the original rendering failed the divider-gap expectation before the UI patch.
- Implemented the fix by introducing a compact mono-metric treatment in [site/components/atoms/MonoMetric.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/components/atoms/MonoMetric.tsx) and applying it only to the preview-card metric grid in [site/components/organisms/SurfacePanelStack.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/components/organisms/SurfacePanelStack.tsx), preserving the larger hero-panel metric treatment while giving split tiles enough breathing room.
- Verification also exposed that the existing site theme-toggle coverage was broken because [site/components/sections/HeaderShell.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/components/sections/HeaderShell.tsx) no longer mounted the toggle. Restored the header toggle and cleaned a pre-existing lint issue in [site/e2e/branding.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/e2e/branding.spec.ts) so the focused standalone-site checks are green again.
- Verified with `cd web && npx playwright test surface-preview.spec.ts --config playwright.site.config.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test branding.spec.ts theme-toggle.spec.ts --config playwright.site.config.ts`, `cd site && npm run lint`, and `cd site && NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-build npm run build`.

## Session: Commit Residual Chart-System Fixes (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph

- T2 (Record the commit/push plan in `tasks/todo.md` before staging) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Stage the residual chart-system files and create a scoped commit with the verified runtime and OG routing fixes) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Push the current branch to origin and capture the resulting review note) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current branch, worktree, and diff so the commit only includes the residual chart-system follow-up files
- [x] T2 Record the commit/push plan in `tasks/todo.md` before staging
- [x] T3 Stage the residual chart-system files and create a scoped commit with the verified runtime and OG routing fixes
- [x] T4 Push the current branch to origin and capture the resulting review note

### Review
- Staged only the residual chart-system follow-up files: the shared shell metadata update, relationship-view primitive convergence, MenthorQ OG family routing, focused Vitest/Playwright regressions, and the task log updates.
- Commit and push completed on `main` after the previously green verification set: `npx vitest run web/tests/chart-runtime-adoption.test.ts web/tests/price-chart-shell.test.ts web/tests/menthorq-og-route-contract.test.ts web/tests/chart-system.test.ts web/tests/og-theme-contract.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/price-chart-theme.spec.ts e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts`, and `cd web && npm run build`.

## Session: Chart System Residual Convergence (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the remaining chart-system residuals in the live-trace modal chart, relationship view shell, and MenthorQ OG route so the follow-up work stays scoped to the declared gaps) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the residual-convergence plan and user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage for live-trace shell metadata, relationship-view shared shell usage, and MenthorQ renderer-family selection) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement the runtime residual fixes for `PriceChart` and `RegimeRelationshipView` using the shared chart primitives with minimal visual regression) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Implement MenthorQ OG family-specific renderer routing for analytical time-series, distribution-bar, and matrix-heatmap outputs) depends_on: [T3]
- T6 (Run targeted verification, update review notes, and confirm the residual chart-system gaps are closed) depends_on: [T4, T5]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the remaining chart-system residuals in the live-trace modal chart, relationship view shell, and MenthorQ OG route so the follow-up work stays scoped to the declared gaps
- [x] T2 Record the residual-convergence plan and user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for live-trace shell metadata, relationship-view shared shell usage, and MenthorQ renderer-family selection
- [x] T4 Implement the runtime residual fixes for `PriceChart` and `RegimeRelationshipView` using the shared chart primitives with minimal visual regression
- [x] T5 Implement MenthorQ OG family-specific renderer routing for analytical time-series, distribution-bar, and matrix-heatmap outputs
- [x] T6 Run targeted verification, update review notes, and confirm the residual chart-system gaps are closed

### Review
- Runtime slice completed: [web/components/charts/ChartPanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/charts/ChartPanel.tsx) now emits chart-family and renderer metadata on the chart shell root, and [web/components/PriceChart.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/PriceChart.tsx) now adopts that shell as a `live-trace` surface so the modal chart participates in the shared chart-system contract instead of bypassing it.
- Updated [web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx) and [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) so the relationship view keeps the shared `ChartPanel` shell while the z-score legend uses the shared `ChartLegend` primitive without the legacy standalone legend styling hook.
- Added direct runtime regression coverage in [web/tests/price-chart-shell.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/price-chart-shell.test.ts), [web/tests/chart-runtime-adoption.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/chart-runtime-adoption.test.ts), [web/e2e/price-chart-theme.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/price-chart-theme.spec.ts), and [web/e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts); targeted Vitest and Playwright verification passed for the runtime slice.
- Downstream slice completed: [web/tests/menthorq-og-route-contract.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/menthorq-og-route-contract.test.ts) now exercises the MenthorQ OG route as code instead of string-matching source, covering analytical time-series, distribution-bar, matrix-heatmap, and unsupported-shape fallback selection.
- Updated [web/app/api/menthorq/[command]/image/route.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/api/menthorq/[command]/image/route.tsx) to replace the generic analytical-only fallback with explicit family routing: command hints now prefer `intraday` and `cryptos_technical` as `analytical-time-series`, `vol`/`eod`/`futures`/`cryptos_options` as `distribution-bar`, and `forex` as `matrix-heatmap`, while unsupported payloads keep the command-family badge and render a clear fallback message instead of a misleading line chart.
- Final targeted verification passed with `npx vitest run web/tests/chart-runtime-adoption.test.ts web/tests/price-chart-shell.test.ts web/tests/menthorq-og-route-contract.test.ts web/tests/chart-system.test.ts web/tests/og-theme-contract.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/price-chart-theme.spec.ts e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts`, and `cd web && npm run build`; the only remaining build note is the pre-existing Next `metadataBase` warning, and the residual chart-system convergence session is now closed.

## Session: Regime Relationship State Tooltips (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the current RVOL/COR1M relationship quadrant UI, shared tooltip component, and existing tooltip test patterns) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the implementation plan in `tasks/todo.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage for a four-state tooltip key in the relationship view) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement info-bubble triggers for all four relationship states in the `/regime` UI without disturbing the existing quadrant plot) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted verification and capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current RVOL/COR1M relationship quadrant UI, shared tooltip component, and existing tooltip test patterns
- [x] T2 Record the implementation plan in `tasks/todo.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for a four-state tooltip key in the relationship view
- [x] T4 Implement info-bubble triggers for all four relationship states in the `/regime` UI without disturbing the existing quadrant plot
- [x] T5 Run targeted verification and capture review notes

### Review
- Added shared state-definition copy in [web/lib/regimeRelationships.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/regimeRelationships.ts) so the four relationship states now have one canonical tooltip definition source.
- Updated [web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx) to render a `STATE KEY` under the quadrant chart with one `InfoTooltip` trigger per state, while preserving the existing quadrant visualization and current-state summary.
- Extended [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) with responsive styling for the new state-key rows so the tooltip affordances stay aligned with the existing instrument-panel system on desktop and mobile.
- Added regression coverage in [web/tests/regime-relationship-tooltips.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-relationship-tooltips.test.ts) and browser coverage in [web/e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts).
- Verified `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-relationship-tooltips.test.ts web/tests/regime-relationship.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts`.

## Session: Regime Relationship State Docs (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect README and strategy/docs surfaces that describe `/regime`, CRI, and the new RVOL/COR1M relationship states) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the documentation plan and the user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Update README and the relevant markdown docs with exact definitions for the four relationship states and the rolling-mean classification rule) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Verify the updated documentation against the current implementation and capture review notes) depends_on: [T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect README and strategy/docs surfaces that describe `/regime`, CRI, and the new RVOL/COR1M relationship states
- [x] T2 Record the documentation plan and the user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Update README and the relevant markdown docs with exact definitions for the four relationship states and the rolling-mean classification rule
- [x] T4 Verify the updated documentation against the current implementation and capture review notes

### Review
- Added operator-facing definitions for all four relationship states in [README.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/README.md), alongside the `/regime` terminal capabilities section, so the meaning of `FRAGILE CALM`, `SYSTEMIC PANIC`, `STOCK PICKER'S MARKET`, and `GOLDILOCKS` is visible without reading the code.
- Added the exact implementation rule to the CRI strategy spec in [docs/strategies.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/docs/strategies.md): the relationship view classifies the latest RVOL/COR1M point against the rolling 20-session means, not against fixed absolute cutoffs.
- Verified the docs against the current implementation in [web/lib/regimeRelationships.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/regimeRelationships.ts), including the live-latest-point override behavior used by `/regime`.

## Session: Chart System Roadmap Steps 1-4 (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the current chart surfaces, audit roadmap, and available cross-language primitive hooks so a shared chart-system contract can drive runtime and downstream outputs) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the step-1-through-4 execution plan in `tasks/todo.md`, including the shared chart-spec artifacts and validation targets) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Implement the shared chart spec, runtime chart shell/primitives, and tokenized chart helpers in `web/`) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Converge OG/report surfaces and sanctioned renderer documentation onto the new chart-system rules) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Add/update regression coverage where practical, run targeted verification, and capture review notes) depends_on: [T3, T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current chart surfaces, audit roadmap, and available cross-language primitive hooks so a shared chart-system contract can drive runtime and downstream outputs
- [x] T2 Record the step-1-through-4 execution plan in `tasks/todo.md`, including the shared chart-spec artifacts and validation targets
- [x] T3 Implement the shared chart spec, runtime chart shell/primitives, and tokenized chart helpers in `web/`
- [x] T4 Converge OG/report surfaces and sanctioned renderer documentation onto the new chart-system rules
- [x] T5 Add/update regression coverage where practical, run targeted verification, and capture review notes

### Review
- Published the shared chart contract in [web/lib/chart-system-spec.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/chart-system-spec.json), exposed runtime helpers in [web/lib/chartSystem.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/chartSystem.ts), and documented the sanctioned families/renderers in [docs/chart-system.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/docs/chart-system.md).
- Extracted shared runtime chart primitives in [web/components/charts/ChartPanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/charts/ChartPanel.tsx) and [web/components/charts/ChartLegend.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/charts/ChartLegend.tsx), then adopted them in [web/components/PerformancePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/PerformancePanel.tsx) and [web/components/CriHistoryChart.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/CriHistoryChart.tsx), while routing runtime series colors through semantic roles in [web/components/RegimePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimePanel.tsx) and [web/components/PriceChart.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/PriceChart.tsx).
- Converged downstream surfaces on the same contract by wiring [web/lib/og-theme.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/og-theme.ts), restoring and aligning [web/lib/og-charts.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/og-charts.tsx), tightening [web/app/api/menthorq/[command]/image/route.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/api/menthorq/[command]/image/route.tsx), and keeping [scripts/performance_explainer_report.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/performance_explainer_report.py) on the shared family/renderer/semantic-role rules.
- Added regression coverage in [web/tests/chart-system.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/chart-system.test.ts), [web/tests/chart-runtime-adoption.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/chart-runtime-adoption.test.ts), [web/tests/og-theme-contract.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/og-theme-contract.test.ts), [web/tests/og-chart-contract.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/og-chart-contract.test.ts), [web/tests/og-chart-system.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/og-chart-system.test.ts), [web/tests/menthorq-og-route-contract.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/menthorq-og-route-contract.test.ts), and [scripts/tests/test_performance_explainer_report.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/tests/test_performance_explainer_report.py).
- Verified with `npx vitest run web/tests/chart-system.test.ts web/tests/chart-runtime-adoption.test.ts web/tests/og-chart-contract.test.ts web/tests/menthorq-og-route-contract.test.ts web/tests/og-theme-contract.test.ts web/tests/og-chart-system.test.ts web/tests/performance-chart-model.test.ts web/tests/performance-chart-theme.test.ts web/tests/performance-chart-axes.test.ts web/tests/regime-history-responsive.test.ts web/tests/regime-history-tooltip.test.ts web/tests/price-chart-theme.test.ts`, `pytest scripts/tests/test_performance_explainer_report.py -q`, `python3 -m py_compile scripts/performance_explainer_report.py`, `python3 scripts/performance_explainer_report.py --no-open --output /tmp/performance-page-explainer-chart-audit.html`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/performance-page.spec.ts e2e/performance-chart-axes.spec.ts e2e/performance-chart-theme.spec.ts e2e/regime-history-responsive.spec.ts e2e/regime-history-tooltip.spec.ts`, and `cd web && npm run build`.
- Residual gaps intentionally left for later follow-up: [web/components/PriceChart.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/PriceChart.tsx) still does not emit `live-trace` shell metadata because it renders inside other panels; [web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx) still uses its own section/legend system; and the generic MenthorQ OG route still falls back to an analytical time-series renderer for arbitrary datasets until command-specific `distribution-bar` and `matrix-heatmap` renderers are added.

## Session: Regime Relationship Analytics View (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the `/regime` history data shape, current chart contracts, and brand constraints so relationship-first analytics can be added without removing the raw history view) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the relationship-analytics plan and the user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage for the new RVOL/COR1M relationship helpers and browser-visible analytics panels) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement additive relationship visuals for spread, quadrant, and normalized divergence with minimal impact to the existing charts) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted verification, update review notes, and confirm the new panels are green without regressing the raw history charts) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the `/regime` history data shape, current chart contracts, and brand constraints so relationship-first analytics can be added without removing the raw history view
- [x] T2 Record the relationship-analytics plan and the user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for the new RVOL/COR1M relationship helpers and browser-visible analytics panels
- [x] T4 Implement additive relationship visuals for spread, quadrant, and normalized divergence with minimal impact to the existing charts
- [x] T5 Run targeted verification, update review notes, and confirm the new panels are green without regressing the raw history charts

### Review
- Added a dedicated relationship analytics helper in [web/lib/regimeRelationships.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/regimeRelationships.ts) so spread, quadrant, and normalized divergence all derive from the same filtered RVOL/COR1M series, with live overrides merged into the latest session when present.
- Wired an additive relationship section into [web/components/RegimePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimePanel.tsx) and implemented the three analytics panels in [web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimeRelationshipView.tsx), preserving the original raw history charts and their existing test hooks.
- Extended the styling in [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) to keep the new panels on the current instrument-panel system and added tooltip copy in [web/lib/sectionTooltips.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/sectionTooltips.ts).
- Verified the relationship helper with `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-relationship-model.test.ts`.
- Verified the browser behavior with `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-relationship-view.spec.ts e2e/regime-rvol-history.spec.ts`, proving the new panels render while the legacy raw RVOL history chart still keeps its 20-point contract.
- Verified the web app compiles with `cd web && npm run build`. The first Turbopack attempt left a stale `.next` temp/lock artifact, but the rerun after clearing the lock completed successfully.

## Session: Repo-Wide Chart Cohesion Audit (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph

### Report Artifact
- Target: `reports/chart-audit-2026-03-11.html`

### Review
- Inventoried the runtime product chart surfaces under `web/` as four families instead of one: live scrub price chart ([web/components/PriceChart.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/PriceChart.tsx)), analytical time-series ([web/components/PerformancePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/PerformancePanel.tsx), [web/components/CriHistoryChart.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/CriHistoryChart.tsx)), distribution/gauge visuals ([web/components/RegimePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimePanel.tsx), [web/components/CtaPage.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/CtaPage.tsx), [web/components/ticker-detail/RatingsTab.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/ticker-detail/RatingsTab.tsx)), and matrix/heatmap-style comparative views ([web/components/ticker-detail/SeasonalityTab.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/ticker-detail/SeasonalityTab.tsx), [web/components/CtaTables.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/CtaTables.tsx)).
- Audited secondary repo references that should influence the eventual chart system without defining runtime behavior: [web/lib/og-charts.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/og-charts.tsx), [web/app/api/menthorq/[command]/image/route.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/api/menthorq/[command]/image/route.tsx), [brand/radon-terminal-mockup.html](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/brand/radon-terminal-mockup.html), [brand/radon-component-kit.html](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/brand/radon-component-kit.html), [scripts/performance_explainer_report.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/performance_explainer_report.py), and [.pi/skills/html-report/THEME.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/.pi/skills/html-report/THEME.md).
- Generated the report at [reports/chart-audit-2026-03-11.html](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/reports/chart-audit-2026-03-11.html). The report documents the current chart taxonomy, same-vs-different analysis, brand-alignment gaps, and a four-step refactor roadmap centered on a shared chart spec rather than a forced single-library rewrite.
- Highest-priority conclusions captured in the report: there is no shared chart shell yet; runtime charts currently span canvas, D3 SVG, custom SVG, and CSS/flex/grid implementations; theme-token adoption is strongest on `/performance` and weakest in `CriHistoryChart` and the modal bar/grid views; and the repo already contains one viable cross-surface chart grammar in [web/lib/og-charts.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/og-charts.tsx), but it is isolated to OG rendering instead of driving runtime and report visuals.
- Tried to open the report with `open` first, but this shell has no working default HTML handler and the installed browser bundles are stubs. Fell back to Quick Look via `qlmanage -p reports/chart-audit-2026-03-11.html`.

## Session: Regime History Charts Responsive Stack (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph

- T4 (Replace the inline two-column history grid with responsive CSS that stacks the charts vertically at narrow widths) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted verification and capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the `/regime` history-chart layout path, current chart container markup, and responsive CSS gaps
- [x] T2 Record the responsive-stack fix plan in `tasks/todo.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for narrow-viewport chart stacking in unit tests and Playwright
- [x] T4 Replace the inline two-column history grid with responsive CSS that stacks the charts vertically at narrow widths
- [x] T5 Run targeted verification and capture review notes

### Review
- Replaced the inline history-chart grid in [RegimePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimePanel.tsx) with a named `regime-history-grid` container so the layout is controlled by CSS instead of a fixed in-component `1fr 1fr` declaration.
- Added responsive rules in [globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) that keep the two charts side by side on wide screens and collapse them to a single stacked column below `960px`, preserving the existing 16px gap and top alignment.
- Locked the contract with [regime-history-responsive.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-history-responsive.test.ts) and [regime-history-responsive.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-history-responsive.spec.ts), then reran the adjacent history tooltip coverage in [regime-history-tooltip.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-history-tooltip.test.ts) and [regime-history-tooltip.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-history-tooltip.spec.ts).
- Verified `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-history-responsive.test.ts web/tests/regime-history-tooltip.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-history-responsive.spec.ts e2e/regime-history-tooltip.spec.ts`.

## Session: Performance Chart Axes Fix (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the `/performance` chart implementation, existing axis styling patterns, and relevant test harnesses
- [x] T2 Record the bug-fix plan and user correction lesson in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for visible performance-chart axes in unit tests and Playwright
- [x] T4 Implement YTD chart axes and labels with minimal layout impact
- [x] T5 Run targeted verification, update review notes, and confirm green state

### Review
- Added a shared chart model in [web/lib/performanceChart.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/performanceChart.ts) so the YTD equity line, rebased benchmark line, filled area, and new axis ticks all derive from one domain instead of separate per-line scaling.
- Updated [web/components/PerformancePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/PerformancePanel.tsx) so the `YTD Equity Curve` now renders an explicit left value axis, a bottom date axis, and stable `performance-axis-x-label` / `performance-axis-y-label` hooks for browser coverage.
- Updated [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) with `performance-axis-line` and `performance-axis-label` styles so the new axes inherit the existing IBM Plex Mono telemetry treatment and the current theme tokens.
- Added unit coverage in [web/tests/performance-chart-model.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/performance-chart-model.test.ts) for shared-domain chart math and axis tick generation, plus browser coverage in [web/e2e/performance-chart-axes.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/performance-chart-axes.spec.ts) for visible x/y labels on `/performance`.
- Kept the adjacent light-theme regression aligned by updating [web/e2e/performance-chart-theme.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/performance-chart-theme.spec.ts) to assert against the browser’s current gradient serialization instead of an overly exact `rgb(...)` string.
- Verified `npx vitest run web/tests/performance-chart-model.test.ts web/tests/performance-chart-theme.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/performance-page.spec.ts e2e/performance-chart-theme.spec.ts e2e/performance-chart-axes.spec.ts`, and `cd web && npm run build`.

## Session: Regime COR1M Day-Over-Day Baseline Fix (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the live COR1M strip calculation, compare the IB close field against the CRI/Cboe prior close, and isolate the incorrect day-over-day baseline) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the correction plan and lesson update in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage proving COR1M day change must anchor to the prior CRI/Cboe close instead of the IB websocket close field) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement the baseline fix in the `/regime` render path with minimal UI impact) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted unit and Playwright verification, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the live COR1M strip calculation, compare the IB close field against the CRI/Cboe prior close, and isolate the incorrect day-over-day baseline
- [x] T2 Record the correction plan and lesson update in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage proving COR1M day change must anchor to the prior CRI/Cboe close instead of the IB websocket close field
- [x] T4 Implement the baseline fix in the `/regime` render path with minimal UI impact
- [x] T5 Run targeted unit and Playwright verification, then capture review notes

### Review
- Updated [cri_scan.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/cri_scan.py) so the CRI payload now preserves `cor1m_previous_close` from the unmodified Cboe daily history and stops overwriting the last historical COR1M bar with the intraday override. The root `cor1m` field can still reflect the best current quote, but the UI now has a clean prior-session anchor.
- Updated [route.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/api/regime/route.ts), [useRegime.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/useRegime.ts), and [RegimePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimePanel.tsx) so the COR1M strip’s day-over-day line uses `data.cor1m_previous_close` (falling back to the last history bar) instead of `prices["COR1M"].close`.
- Locked the payload and UI contract with [test_cri_scan.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py), [regime-cor1m-live.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-cor1m-live.test.ts), and browser assertions in [regime-cor1m-live-stream.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-cor1m-live-stream.spec.ts), while keeping adjacent regime regressions green in [regime-cor1m.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-cor1m.spec.ts) and [regime-day-change.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-day-change.spec.ts).
- Refreshed the live cache with `bash scripts/run_cri_scan.sh`. [cri.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/data/cri.json) now has `date=2026-03-10`, `cor1m_previous_close=28.97`, and `history[-1].cor1m=28.97`, and the newest scheduled snapshot at [cri-2026-03-11T13-51.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/data/cri_scheduled/cri-2026-03-11T13-51.json) matches that corrected baseline.
- Verified `pytest scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py -q`, `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-cor1m-live.test.ts`, `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-market-closed-values.test.ts web/tests/regime-market-closed.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-cor1m-live-stream.spec.ts e2e/regime-cor1m.spec.ts e2e/regime-day-change.spec.ts`, and `bash scripts/run_cri_scan.sh`.

## Session: Performance Chart Theme Fix (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the `/performance` chart implementation, current theme plumbing, and existing chart-theme test patterns) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the bug-fix plan and user correction lesson in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage for performance-chart theme behavior in unit tests and Playwright) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement light-theme-aware chart and chart-meta styling on `/performance` with minimal UI changes) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted verification, update review notes, and confirm green state) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the `/performance` chart implementation, current theme plumbing, and existing chart-theme test patterns
- [x] T2 Record the bug-fix plan and user correction lesson in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for performance-chart theme behavior in unit tests and Playwright
- [x] T4 Implement light-theme-aware chart and chart-meta styling on `/performance` with minimal UI changes
- [x] T5 Run targeted verification, update review notes, and confirm green state

### Review
- Updated [web/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css) so the `/performance` chart surface, grid lines, benchmark stroke, and chart meta tiles now use dedicated theme variables instead of hardcoded dark RGBA values. The dark palette preserves the existing look; the light palette now switches the chart to a bright neutral surface that matches the rest of the app.
- Added source-level regression coverage in [web/tests/performance-chart-theme.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/performance-chart-theme.test.ts) to lock the CSS contract on `--performance-chart-bg`, `--performance-chart-grid`, and `--performance-chart-meta-bg`.
- Added browser coverage in [web/e2e/performance-chart-theme.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/performance-chart-theme.spec.ts), which starts `/performance` in dark mode, toggles to light, and asserts that both the chart surface and the meta tiles actually change palette.
- Verified `npx vitest run web/tests/performance-chart-theme.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/performance-chart-theme.spec.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/performance-page.spec.ts e2e/performance-chart-theme.spec.ts`, and `cd web && npm run build`.

## Session: Regime COR1M Strip Pattern Alignment (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the current COR1M strip card layout and the neighboring strip-card pattern the user wants matched) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the user correction and implementation plan in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage for COR1M daily-change placement and 5d-change subline behavior) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement the COR1M strip layout so it shows the daily change line and moves 5d change into the subline) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted unit and Playwright verification, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current COR1M strip card layout and the neighboring strip-card pattern the user wants matched
- [x] T2 Record the user correction and implementation plan in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for COR1M daily-change placement and 5d-change subline behavior
- [x] T4 Implement the COR1M strip layout so it shows the daily change line and moves 5d change into the subline
- [x] T5 Run targeted unit and Playwright verification, then capture review notes

### Review
- Updated [RegimePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimePanel.tsx) so the COR1M strip now matches the neighboring metric-card hierarchy: live value first, the standard `DayChange` line from IB `last` vs `close` second, and the cached 5-session context moved into the muted `regime-strip-sub` line.
- Preserved the existing live-COR1M behavior from the earlier fix by keeping `prices["COR1M"].last` as the displayed intraday value, but added the missing `prices["COR1M"].close` input so the daily move and arrow render the same way as VIX, VVIX, and SPY.
- Locked the layout contract with source-level assertions in [regime-cor1m-live.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-cor1m-live.test.ts) and browser assertions in [regime-cor1m-live-stream.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-cor1m-live-stream.spec.ts), [regime-cor1m.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-cor1m.spec.ts), and [regime-day-change.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-day-change.spec.ts).
- Verified `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-cor1m-live.test.ts`, `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-market-closed-values.test.ts web/tests/regime-market-closed.test.ts`, and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-cor1m-live-stream.spec.ts e2e/regime-cor1m.spec.ts e2e/regime-day-change.spec.ts`.

## Session: Regime COR1M Live Feed Wiring (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the current `/regime` COR1M render path, IB subscription inputs, and existing test coverage to isolate why live COR1M is not displayed) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the user correction and live-feed implementation plan in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing regression coverage for live COR1M rendering and badge behavior on `/regime`) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement live COR1M preference from the IB price stream with cached CRI fallback and preserve the daily 5d change context) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted unit and Playwright verification, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current `/regime` COR1M render path, IB subscription inputs, and existing test coverage to isolate why live COR1M is not displayed
- [x] T2 Record the user correction and live-feed implementation plan in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for live COR1M rendering and badge behavior on `/regime`
- [x] T4 Implement live COR1M preference from the IB price stream with cached CRI fallback and preserve the daily 5d change context
- [x] T5 Run targeted unit and Playwright verification, then capture review notes

### Review
- Updated [RegimePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimePanel.tsx) so `/regime` now prefers `prices["COR1M"].last` during market hours, falls back to `data.cor1m` when no live tick is available, and carries the live COR1M value into the correlation component, crash-trigger row, and RVOL/COR1M history chart.
- Kept the existing CRI-derived 5-session change context intact, so the COR1M strip still shows the cached `data.cor1m_5d_change` while the main displayed COR1M level can update from IB in real time.
- Added source-level regression coverage in [regime-cor1m-live.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-cor1m-live.test.ts) and browser coverage in [regime-cor1m-live-stream.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-cor1m-live-stream.spec.ts) with a mocked websocket COR1M tick.
- Updated [CLAUDE.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/CLAUDE.md) so the repo spec now matches the runtime behavior: COR1M remains daily-only when the market is closed, but can render live from IB during market hours.
- Verified `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-cor1m-live.test.ts web/tests/regime-market-closed-values.test.ts web/tests/regime-market-closed.test.ts` and `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-cor1m-live-stream.spec.ts e2e/regime-market-closed-eod.spec.ts e2e/regime-cor1m.spec.ts`.

## Session: Regime History Tooltip Copy And Placement (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the Regime history header, shared tooltip copy, and existing unit/Playwright test patterns for the smallest safe fix) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the user-facing fix plan and correction lesson in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]

- T4 (Implement the history-header layout adjustment and rewrite the tooltip copy to explain the visible data without implementation details) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted unit and Playwright verification, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the Regime history header, shared tooltip copy, and existing unit/Playwright test patterns for the smallest safe fix
- [x] T2 Record the user-facing fix plan and correction lesson in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for the 20-session history header contract and tooltip copy on `/regime`
- [x] T4 Implement the history-header layout adjustment and rewrite the tooltip copy to explain the visible data without implementation details
- [x] T5 Run targeted unit and Playwright verification, then capture review notes

### Review
- Reworked the history header in [web/components/RegimePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/RegimePanel.tsx) so the `20-SESSION HISTORY` label and `?` icon now live in a shared `section-title` group while the optional `LIVE` badge remains on the right edge of the section header.
- Extended [web/components/InfoTooltip.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/InfoTooltip.tsx) with optional test ids so the history tooltip can be targeted directly in browser coverage without changing behavior for the other tooltips in the app.
- Replaced the stale implementation-oriented history copy in [web/lib/sectionTooltips.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/sectionTooltips.ts) with a `20-SESSION HISTORY` entry that explains what the left and right charts mean in user-facing terms and removes D3/WS/websocket references.
- Added a source-level regression in [web/tests/regime-history-tooltip.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-history-tooltip.test.ts) and a browser regression in [web/e2e/regime-history-tooltip.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-history-tooltip.spec.ts) to lock the header grouping, tooltip trigger placement, and plain-English copy.
- Verified `npx vitest run web/tests/regime-history-tooltip.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-history-tooltip.spec.ts`, and `cd web && npm run build` all pass.

## Session: CRI Cache Refresh Remediation (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the live CRI cache artifacts, the current scanner failure mode, and why `/regime` is still serving missing RVOL history) depends_on: []

- T5 (Verify the regenerated cache contents and targeted tests, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the live CRI cache artifacts, the current scanner failure mode, and why `/regime` is still serving missing RVOL history
- [x] T2 Record the remediation plan and the user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for the CBOE-before-Yahoo COR1M fallback and for live `/regime` RVOL history visibility
- [x] T4 Implement the CBOE COR1M fallback plus doc updates, then ensure the route-visible CRI cache and newest scheduled snapshot are valid
- [x] T5 Verify the regenerated cache contents and targeted tests, then capture review notes

### Review
- Updated [scripts/cri_scan.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/cri_scan.py) so COR1M history and fallback quote selection now use the official Cboe dashboard feed before Yahoo Finance, while preserving the earlier IB client-id retry path.
- Added regression coverage in [scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py) for the new source order and in [web/e2e/regime-rvol-history-live-cache.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-rvol-history-live-cache.spec.ts) for the browser-visible “20 RVOL dots from live cache” contract.
- Updated [README.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/README.md), [docs/strategies.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/docs/strategies.md), [.pi/AGENTS.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/.pi/AGENTS.md), [.pi/prompts/cri-scan.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/.pi/prompts/cri-scan.md), and [.pi/skills/html-report/SKILL.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/.pi/skills/html-report/SKILL.md) so the repo now documents the COR1M source order as IB → official Cboe dashboard feed → Yahoo last resort.
- Confirmed the route-visible cache state is valid now: [data/cri.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/data/cri.json) has 20 history rows, 20 numeric `realized_vol` values, and 40 cached `spy_closes`; a fresh valid scheduled snapshot was also written at [cri-2026-03-11T13-24.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/data/cri_scheduled/cri-2026-03-11T13-24.json).
- Verified the final path with `python3 scripts/cri_scan.py --json > /tmp/cri-refresh.json`, `bash scripts/run_cri_scan.sh`, `pytest scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py scripts/tests/test_cri_client_id.py -q`, `npx playwright test e2e/regime-rvol-history-live-cache.spec.ts e2e/regime-cor1m-live-route.spec.ts`, `bash -n scripts/run_cri_scan.sh`, and `bash -n scripts/run_data_refresh.sh`.

## Session: Site Light Theme Toggle (2026-03-11)

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Audit the `/site` theme surface, existing header structure, and available unit/E2E test harnesses without disturbing unrelated worktree changes
- [x] T2 Record the light-theme implementation and verification plan in `tasks/todo.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression coverage for site theme state resolution, header toggle rendering, and browser-visible light/dark switching

### Review
- Added the site theme state contract in [theme.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/lib/theme.ts) and covered it in [theme.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/lib/theme.test.ts), so the site now resolves a saved `theme` preference first, falls back to the browser color-scheme when no saved value exists, and exposes a deterministic dark/light toggle path.
- Wired the persisted theme into the document shell in [layout.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/layout.tsx) with a bootstrap script plus `html[data-theme]`, which lets the marketing site switch palettes before hydration while still keeping the rest of the page server-rendered.
- Reused the in-progress client boundary in [ThemeToggle.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/components/atoms/ThemeToggle.tsx) and mounted it in [HeaderShell.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/components/sections/HeaderShell.tsx), adding a header-level toggle button that persists to `localStorage`, updates the `theme-color` meta tag, and remains keyboard accessible.
- Expanded the semantic token overrides in [globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/globals.css) so the site gets a true light theme without breaking the Radon terminal geometry; also updated the accent-button text in [page.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/page.tsx), [HeroSection.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/components/sections/HeroSection.tsx), [HeaderShell.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/components/sections/HeaderShell.tsx), and [FinalCTASection.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/components/sections/FinalCTASection.tsx) so the CTA contrast stays correct in light mode.
- Added a site-specific Playwright harness in [playwright.site.config.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/playwright.site.config.ts) and the browser regression in [theme-toggle.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/e2e/theme-toggle.spec.ts), which proves the site honors a saved light theme on load and persists dark→light toggles in the browser.
- Updated [site/.gitignore](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/.gitignore) and [site/eslint.config.mjs](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/eslint.config.mjs) so the dedicated `.next-site-playwright/` dev output used by the site E2E harness stays out of git status and lint.
- Verified `npx vitest run site/lib/theme.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test theme-toggle.spec.ts --config playwright.site.config.ts`, `cd site && npm run lint`, and `cd site && NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-build npm run build`.

## Session: Site Docs Checkpoint And SEO Audit (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Audit the current `/site` worktree, documentation gaps, generated artifact noise, and the unresolved non-site WIP that must stay out of the checkpoint commit) depends_on: []
- T2 (Update docs and ignore rules for the landing-page batch, then create a scoped checkpoint commit for finished `/site` work only) depends_on: [T1]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Audit the current `/site` worktree, documentation gaps, generated artifact noise, and the unresolved non-site WIP that must stay out of the checkpoint commit
- [ ] T2 Update docs and ignore rules for the landing-page batch, then create a scoped checkpoint commit for finished `/site` work only
- [x] T3 Audit the live `/site` SEO surface, identify crawl/indexation/share gaps, and write failing or objective verification around the new SEO contract where practical

- [ ] T5 Run targeted verification for metadata/routes/build/report generation, then capture review notes and a second scoped commit for the SEO pass

### Review
- Added a shared SEO contract in [site/lib/seo.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/lib/seo.ts) and wired it into [site/app/layout.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/layout.tsx) so the marketing site now emits canonical metadata, Open Graph and Twitter cards, a manifest link, theme color, and JSON-LD for `WebSite`, `Organization`, and `SoftwareApplication`.
- Added crawl/share routes in [site/app/robots.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/robots.ts), [site/app/sitemap.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/sitemap.ts), [site/app/manifest.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/manifest.ts), [site/app/opengraph-image.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/opengraph-image.tsx), and [site/app/twitter-image.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/twitter-image.tsx), plus link-hardening and semantic-nav updates in the landing-page sections so the single-page site has first-party crawl and share surfaces.
- Added regression coverage in [site/lib/seo.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/lib/seo.test.ts) and updated [vitest.config.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/vitest.config.ts) so site-level SEO tests are included in the repo’s normal Vitest suite.
- Added [site_seo_audit.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/site_seo_audit.py), which audits either a live site URL or the built Next artifacts under `site/.next-build/server/app`, then writes the branded HTML report at [site-seo-audit-2026-03-11.html](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/reports/site-seo-audit-2026-03-11.html).
- Updated [site/README.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/README.md) and [README.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/README.md) so the production-site URL requirement, crawl/share routes, and audit workflow are documented for both live-URL and build-artifact verification.
- Verified `npx vitest run site/lib/seo.test.ts`, `cd site && npm run lint`, `cd site && NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-build npx next build --webpack`, `python3 -m py_compile scripts/site_seo_audit.py`, and `python3 scripts/site_seo_audit.py --build-dir site/.next-build/server/app`, with the final audit reporting `18 pass, 0 warn, 0 fail`.
- Attempted to stage and commit the scoped site batch, but this session cannot write inside `.git/` (`fatal: Unable to create '.git/index.lock': Operation not permitted`), so the commit itself remains blocked outside the repo content changes.

## Session: RVOL Docs, Commit Checkpoint, And Fullscreen Toggle (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Audit the current RVOL-fix worktree, documentation update targets, and the shell/header implementation that owns the theme selector) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the docs + commit + fullscreen plan in `tasks/todo.md`) depends_on: [T1]

- [x] T2 Record the docs + commit + fullscreen plan in `tasks/todo.md`
- [x] T3 Update the relevant docs for the RVOL cache/backfill fix and create a scoped commit for the CRI/RVOL work

- [x] T5 Implement the fullscreen toggle next to the theme selector and wire document-level Escape handling
- [x] T6 Run targeted verification for docs/build/tests/browser behavior, then capture review notes

### Review
- Updated the CRI/regime docs in [README.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/README.md), [docs/strategies.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/docs/strategies.md), and [docs/status.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/docs/status.md) to describe the richer CRI cache selection, 20-session RVOL backfill behavior, and the post-close cache refresh path.
- Committed the scoped RVOL/cache/docs checkpoint as `27e78a7` (`fix: restore regime rvol history from cri cache`) without pulling in the unrelated site/worktree changes that were already present in the repo.
- Added the fullscreen control in [Header.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/Header.tsx) and [WorkspaceShell.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/WorkspaceShell.tsx), using `Maximize2` / `Minimize2` icons and a document-level Escape handler that exits fullscreen when the app is expanded.
- Kept the existing theme button uniquely targetable by moving the new control onto its own `.fullscreen-toggle` class and sharing the button styling in [globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/globals.css).
- Added fullscreen regressions in [header-fullscreen-control.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/header-fullscreen-control.test.ts) and [header-fullscreen.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/header-fullscreen.spec.ts).
- Verified `pytest scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py -q`, `npx vitest run web/tests/cri-cache-selection.test.ts web/tests/regime-history-backfill.test.ts web/tests/regime-route-cache-selection.test.ts web/tests/header-fullscreen-control.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-rvol-history.spec.ts e2e/regime-rvol-history-live-route.spec.ts e2e/header-fullscreen.spec.ts`, `bash -n scripts/run_cri_scan.sh && bash -n scripts/run_data_refresh.sh`, and `cd web && npm run build`.
- Additional sanity check: the theme-toggle-only cases in [price-chart-theme.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/price-chart-theme.spec.ts) still pass. Two older modal-opening cases in that same spec are still failing because the stubbed AAPL ticker-detail modal never appears; that failure is outside the fullscreen path and was not part of this task.

## Session: Regime RVOL History Cache Fix (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Audit the `/regime` RVOL/COR1M chart data flow, existing CRI cache artifacts, and the post-close sync hooks) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the RVOL history cache fix plan in `tasks/todo.md`) depends_on: [T1]

- T5 (Run targeted verification with Python tests, web tests, and Playwright E2E) depends_on: [T4]
- T6 (Capture review notes and verification results for the RVOL history fix) depends_on: [T5]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Audit the `/regime` RVOL/COR1M chart data flow, existing CRI cache artifacts, and the post-close sync hooks
- [x] T2 Record the RVOL history cache fix plan in `tasks/todo.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression tests for RVOL history backfill, cache normalization, and `/regime` browser rendering
- [x] T4 Implement 20-session RVOL history backfill plus post-close CRI cache refresh in the daily sync path
- [x] T5 Run targeted verification with Python tests, web tests, and Playwright E2E
- [x] T6 Capture review notes and verification results for the RVOL history fix

### Review
- Expanded the CRI payload in [scripts/cri_scan.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/cri_scan.py) so cached `spy_closes` now preserve the trailing 40 daily closes, which is enough to reconstruct realized-vol values for the full 20-session chart instead of only today’s point.
- Added [regimeHistory.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/lib/regimeHistory.ts) and wired it into [route.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/api/regime/route.ts) so `/api/regime` backfills missing `history[].realized_vol` values from cached SPY closes before the page renders the RVOL/COR1M chart.
- Updated the post-close path in [run_data_refresh.sh](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/run_data_refresh.sh) so the daily sync refreshes `data/cri.json` and writes a new scheduled CRI snapshot after 4:00 PM ET whenever the current cache is missing a complete 20-session RVOL history.
- Added regressions in [test_cri_scan.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py), [regime-history-backfill.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/regime-history-backfill.test.ts), and [regime-rvol-history.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/regime-rvol-history.spec.ts) to lock the cache contract, API repair path, and live-route browser rendering.
- Verified `pytest scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py -q`, `npx tsx --test web/tests/regime-history-backfill.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/regime-rvol-history.spec.ts`, `bash -n scripts/run_data_refresh.sh`, and `cd web && npm run build`.

## Session: Site Landing Page Phase 4 Implementation (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Audit the current `/site` implementation, package setup, and brand constraints for the landing-page refactor) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the Phase 4 implementation plan in `tasks/todo.md`) depends_on: [T1]

- T4 (Replace the existing homepage with the new institutional-terminal landing page and supporting content/data) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Verify the redesigned `/site` with build and browser automation, then capture review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Audit the current `/site` implementation, package setup, and brand constraints for the landing-page refactor
- [x] T2 Record the Phase 4 implementation plan in `tasks/todo.md`
- [x] T3 Refactor `/site` into Radon-native atoms, molecules, organisms, and section components
- [x] T4 Replace the existing homepage with the new institutional-terminal landing page and supporting content/data
- [x] T5 Verify the redesigned `/site` with build and browser automation, then capture review notes

### Review
- Replaced the old monolithic homepage with a section-composed landing page in [site/app/page.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/page.tsx) and a reusable `/site/components` architecture built around Radon-native atoms, molecules, organisms, and sections.
- The redesign now centers the product on strategies, execution, and state reconstruction, with dedicated sections for the strategy matrix, execution rail, surface preview, auditability layer, and final operator CTA.
- Preserved Radon’s enforced design system in [site/app/globals.css](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/app/globals.css) and the section/component primitives: dark-first surfaces, teal `signal.core`, hairline borders, tight panel geometry, mono telemetry, and depth via layered surfaces instead of soft shadows or glassmorphism.
- Consolidated the richer landing-page content model in [site/lib/landing-content.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/lib/landing-content.ts) and reconciled mixed worktree component contracts so the active section tree compiles cleanly against a single data shape.
- Updated [site/.gitignore](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/.gitignore) to ignore `.next-build/` and `.next-dev-webpack/`, so the alternate build paths used for verification do not leave untracked noise in the worktree.
- Verified `cd site && npm run lint` passes.
- Verified `cd site && NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-build npm run build` passes, using an alternate `distDir` to avoid a live `.next` lock held by another local Next process.
- Added [site/next.config.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/next.config.ts) support for environment-scoped `distDir` values and an explicit Turbopack root so site verification can run without colliding with other local site processes.
- Verified live browser rendering on a dedicated webpack dev server with `cd site && NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-dev-webpack npx next dev -p 3335 --webpack`.
- Verified browser automation from the repo’s Playwright install against `http://127.0.0.1:3335`, asserting the hero, strategy, execution, and audit sections and capturing `/tmp/radon-site-phase4.png`.


## Session: Performance Card Explainability Modals (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the current `/performance` panel and the existing clickable metric-card pattern used on `/portfolio`) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the implementation plan for clickable performance cards in `tasks/todo.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add failing browser or route coverage for clickable performance cards and their explanatory modal content) depends_on: [T1, T2]
- T4 (Implement clickable cards and explanatory modal content across the `/performance` page) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted verification with Playwright browser automation and supporting tests) depends_on: [T4]
- T6 (Capture review notes and summarize the final behavior) depends_on: [T5]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current `/performance` panel and the existing clickable metric-card pattern used on `/portfolio`
- [x] T2 Record the implementation plan for clickable performance cards in `tasks/todo.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing browser or route coverage for clickable performance cards and their explanatory modal content
- [x] T4 Implement clickable cards and explanatory modal content across the `/performance` page
- [x] T5 Run targeted verification with Playwright browser automation and supporting tests
- [x] T6 Capture review notes and summarize the final behavior

### Review
- Scoped the clickable behavior to the eight actual `StatCard` metric cards in the Core Performance section of [PerformancePanel.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/PerformancePanel.tsx), which matches the existing `/portfolio` interaction pattern without turning non-card list rows into fake cards.
- Added [MetricDefinitionModal.tsx](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/components/MetricDefinitionModal.tsx) so each performance card can explain both what the metric means and how it is calculated, instead of only showing a formula string.
- Converted all eight core performance cards into accessible button-style metric cards with `metric-card-clickable`, stable `data-testid` values, and per-metric definition/formula content wired from the reconstructed performance payload.
- Added browser coverage in [performance-page.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/performance-page.spec.ts) to prove the cards are clickable and that representative cards open the expected explainability modal content.
- Verified `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/performance-page.spec.ts --grep "performance metric cards are clickable"`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/performance-page.spec.ts`, and `cd web && npm run build`.

## Session: Performance Net Liq Reconciliation Fix (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the current performance reconstruction engine, API freshness behavior, and existing tests to define exact failing cases) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the implementation plan for the reconciliation fix in `tasks/todo.md`) depends_on: [T1]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the current performance reconstruction engine, API freshness behavior, and existing tests to define exact failing cases
- [x] T2 Record the implementation plan for the reconciliation fix in `tasks/todo.md`
- [x] T3 Add failing regression tests for Flex trade-date normalization, ending-equity anchoring, and stale `/api/performance` behavior

- [x] T5 Add or update browser coverage for the user-visible reconciliation behavior on `/performance`
- [x] T6 Run targeted verification, capture review notes, and summarize the root-cause fix

### Review
- Fixed the core reconstruction bug in [scripts/portfolio_performance.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/portfolio_performance.py) by normalizing trade dates before parsing and replay, so raw Flex `YYYYMMDD` dates now align with the `YYYY-MM-DD` benchmark calendar used for the YTD curve.
- Hardened the performance payload builder so option-history fetch failures no longer abort the entire sync; missing option marks are downgraded to warnings plus `contracts_missing_history`, allowing the ending equity to stay anchored to the current account snapshot.
- Updated [web/app/api/performance/route.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/app/api/performance/route.ts) so the route detects when cached performance is behind the current portfolio snapshot and refreshes the persisted payload before serving it, with cached fallback if the sync fails.
- Expanded [scripts/tests/test_portfolio_performance.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/tests/test_portfolio_performance.py), [web/tests/performance-route.test.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/tests/performance-route.test.ts), and [web/e2e/performance-page.spec.ts](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/web/e2e/performance-page.spec.ts) to cover compact Flex dates, stale cache refresh, and the browser-visible ending-equity reconciliation behavior.
- Verified the live reconstruction path after the fix: `python3 scripts/portfolio_performance.py --json` completed successfully and matched `data/portfolio.json` exactly with `ending_equity == account_summary.net_liquidation == 1308382.19`.

## Session: Performance YTD Reconciliation Investigation (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the performance engine, web route, and portfolio net liquidation source to map the current YTD calculation flow) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the investigation plan and the user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Compare the live or cached `/performance` and `/portfolio` payloads to locate the source of the mismatch) depends_on: [T1]
- T4 (Explain the exact YTD methodology and identify the most likely root cause of the discrepancy) depends_on: [T2, T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the performance engine, web route, and portfolio net liquidation source to map the current YTD calculation flow
- [x] T2 Record the investigation plan and the user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Compare the live or cached `/performance` and `/portfolio` payloads to locate the source of the mismatch
- [x] T4 Explain the exact YTD methodology and identify the most likely root cause of the discrepancy

### Review
- Confirmed the `/performance` page is a reconstructed close-to-close YTD curve built from trade cash flows plus daily marks, not a live account-equity history.
- Confirmed the `/portfolio` page reads `data/portfolio.json` with a 60-second stale window, while `/performance` reads `data/performance.json` with a 15-minute stale window and serves the old cache immediately while refreshing in the background.
- Observed a live mismatch between the two payloads during the investigation: `/api/performance` was still serving `as_of: 2026-03-10` with `ending_equity: 1063031.8637`, while `/api/portfolio` was serving `last_sync: 2026-03-11T06:37:14.669874` with `account_summary.net_liquidation: 1313112.03`.
- Running `scripts/portfolio_performance.py --json` against the current portfolio snapshot still produced a mismatched ending equity, which shows the issue is not only cache staleness.
- The most likely engine bug is trade-date normalization in `parse_flex_trade_rows()`: Flex trade dates are being consumed as `YYYYMMDD`, while the benchmark calendar uses `YYYY-MM-DD`. That breaks the day matching inside `reconstruct_equity_curve()` and can prevent fills from ever being applied on the intended dates.
- A second degradation path is active as well: when IB Flex is rate-limited, the script falls back to `data/blotter.json`, which can lag the current portfolio and therefore cannot reliably explain the live holdings on `/portfolio`.

## Session: Codex Skill YAML Fixes (2026-03-11)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect the affected `SKILL.md` files under `~/.codex/skills` and identify the invalid YAML frontmatter) depends_on: []
- T2 (Record the task plan and the user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Patch the invalid `description` frontmatter fields so each skill manifest uses a string, not a sequence) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Validate both skill manifests with a direct YAML/frontmatter parse check) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Capture review notes and summarize which files were fixed) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect the affected `SKILL.md` files under `~/.codex/skills` and identify the invalid YAML frontmatter
- [x] T2 Record the task plan and the user correction in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] T3 Patch the invalid `description` frontmatter fields so each skill manifest uses a string, not a sequence
- [x] T4 Validate both skill manifests with a direct YAML/frontmatter parse check
- [x] T5 Capture review notes and summarize which files were fixed

### Review
- Inspected both reported skill manifests under `~/.codex/skills` and confirmed only `metal-macos-replatform/SKILL.md` was malformed; `metal-macos/SKILL.md` already had a valid string-valued `description`.
- The root cause was YAML frontmatter using bracketed placeholder text after `description:` in `metal-macos-replatform/SKILL.md`, which YAML parses as a sequence instead of the string type expected by the Codex skill loader.
- Rewrote that `description` field as a plain string while keeping the skill intent intact.
- Validated both manifests with a direct frontmatter parse check using `yaml.safe_load`, confirming `description` resolves to `str` for both files.
- Result: the repeated "invalid YAML: description: invalid type: sequence, expected a string" loader warning should stop on the next skill discovery/load cycle.

## Session: Performance Page Explainer Report (2026-03-11)

- [x] T1 Audit the live `/performance` page and backend metric engine to enumerate every rendered item
- [x] T2 Document the plan and output requirements for the HTML explainer report
- [x] T3 Implement a generated HTML report that maps every displayed metric to its value, formula, and definition
- [x] T4 Validate the report against current `data/performance.json` or live `/api/performance`, then open it locally
- [x] T5 Capture review notes and final output path in the task log

### Review
- Added [performance_explainer_report.py](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/scripts/performance_explainer_report.py), a reusable generator that reads the current `data/performance.json` payload and emits a standalone HTML explainer for every currently visible `/performance` item.
- The report covers the hero banner, source/drawdown pills, all eight core performance cards, the chart header/legend/meta block, all tail/path-risk items, all distribution/capture items, methodology provenance, and each warning flag.
- Each row in the report includes the page item's current display, the exact formula or provenance used to render it, and a plain-English institutional definition.
- Generated output at [performance-page-explainer-2026-03-11.html](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/reports/performance-page-explainer-2026-03-11.html) and opened it locally with the standard browser-open flow.
- Verified the file exists, has content, and includes the expected sections: Hero Banner, Core Performance, Tail And Path Risk, Methodology, and Warnings.

## Session: Portfolio Performance Route (2026-03-10)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Audit existing portfolio, blotter, benchmark, and web route plumbing for a new performance surface) depends_on: []
- T2 (Define YTD performance methodology, institutional metric set, and library strategy from primary-source research) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Add backend/unit tests for trade parsing, curve reconstruction, and metric calculations) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Implement Python performance engine, cache artifact, and benchmark/price fetch path) depends_on: [T3]

- T8 (Run verification, update relevant docs, and capture review notes/risks) depends_on: [T4, T5, T6, T7]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Audit existing portfolio, blotter, benchmark, and web route plumbing for a new performance surface
- [x] T2 Define YTD performance methodology, institutional metric set, and library strategy from primary-source research
- [x] T3 Add backend/unit tests for trade parsing, curve reconstruction, and metric calculations
- [x] T4 Implement Python performance engine, cache artifact, and benchmark/price fetch path
- [x] T5 Expose performance data through a new web API contract and shared types
- [x] T6 Add the `/performance` route, section wiring, and branded performance panel UI
- [x] T7 Add browser coverage for the new page and confirm rendered metrics against the API contract
- [x] T8 Run verification, update relevant docs, and capture review notes/risks

### Review
- Reused and completed the in-repo `scripts/portfolio_performance.py` engine instead of adding a new analytics dependency. The metric formulas stay local, align to `empyrical` / `quantstats` conventions, and compute a reconstructed YTD equity curve from IB Flex executions plus historical marks.
- Added focused backend coverage in `scripts/tests/test_portfolio_performance.py` for OCC-style option ID formatting, option mark selection, curve replay, core institutional metrics, and the top-level payload contract that feeds the web route.
- Refreshed `data/performance.json` from the live script so the existing `/api/performance` cache and the new UI load the same contract.
- Wired the new `performance` workspace section into the Next.js terminal, added a dedicated `PerformancePanel`, and surfaced the institutional metrics stack: YTD return, ending equity, Sharpe, Sortino, max drawdown, beta, alpha, information ratio, VaR/CVaR, charted YTD equity vs benchmark, and methodology/warning panels.
- Added targeted route metadata coverage in `web/tests/chat.test.ts`, `web/tests/data.test.ts`, and `web/tests/performance-route.test.ts`, plus mocked browser automation in `web/e2e/performance-page.spec.ts`.
- Caught and fixed a payload-contract bug during final verification: `summary.trading_days` was being overwritten by return-count metrics. The payload now reports full YTD session count, and the refreshed cache plus live `/api/performance` route both return `46` series points with `46` trading days.
- Verified `pytest scripts/tests/test_portfolio_performance.py -q`, `npx vitest run web/tests/chat.test.ts web/tests/data.test.ts web/tests/performance-route.test.ts`, `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/performance-page.spec.ts`, and `cd web && npm run build`.
- Residual risk: the reconstructed curve is anchored to current net liquidation and assumes no unmodeled external cash flows inside the observed window; that caveat is exposed directly in the API warnings and rendered on the page.

## Session: Vercel Site Build Gate (2026-03-10)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect current repo/Vercel configuration and confirm the site app deployment root assumptions) depends_on: []
- T2 (Add a repo-side Vercel ignored-build rule so the site deploy only runs when `/site` changes) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Document the site deployment gating behavior in the relevant README files) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Run targeted validation for the ignore-step script and prepare a scoped commit/push) depends_on: [T2, T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect current repo/Vercel configuration and confirm the site app deployment root assumptions
- [x] T2 Add a repo-side Vercel ignored-build rule so the site deploy only runs when `/site` changes
- [x] T3 Document the site deployment gating behavior in the relevant README files
- [x] T4 Run targeted validation for the ignore-step script and prepare a scoped commit/push

### Review
- Added [site/vercel.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/vercel.json) with a Vercel `ignoreCommand` and implemented the git-diff gate in [vercel-ignore-build.mjs](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/scripts/vercel-ignore-build.mjs).
- The ignore-step script now only skips the deploy when it can prove there were no changes under `site/`; if the previous SHA or diff lookup is unavailable, it continues the build instead of risking a false skip.
- Documented the deployment behavior in [site/README.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/site/README.md) and the repo-level [README.md](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/README.md), including the requirement that the Vercel project Root Directory be `site/`.
- Verified the ignore-step locally from both the site root and repo root with identical SHAs: `node scripts/vercel-ignore-build.mjs` and `node site/scripts/vercel-ignore-build.mjs` both exited `0` and reported that the build would be skipped.

## Session: COR1M Current Value Fix (2026-03-10)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Audit current COR1M sourcing, cache flow, and UI expectations for the mismatch) depends_on: []
- T2 (Add failing backend and browser regressions for COR1M current-value sourcing) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Implement CRI scan fix so COR1M current value comes from quote metadata/current quote, not the daily-bar close) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Refresh CRI cache artifacts and align any affected generated files) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Run targeted verification and capture review notes) depends_on: [T3, T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Audit current COR1M sourcing, cache flow, and UI expectations for the mismatch
- [x] T2 Add failing backend and browser regressions for COR1M current-value sourcing
- [x] T3 Implement CRI scan fix so COR1M current value comes from quote metadata/current quote, not the daily-bar close
- [x] T4 Refresh CRI cache artifacts and align any affected generated files
- [x] T5 Run targeted verification and capture review notes

### Review
- Confirmed red phase: `pytest scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py -q` failed on the new `current_override` and `current_quotes` expectations before the fix.
- Backend fix now separates COR1M current-level sourcing from historical bars: `run_analysis()` accepts `current_quotes`, `cor1m_level_and_change()` supports a current override, and the last history row is patched to the selected current quote.
- Added current-quote source selection for COR1M in `scripts/cri_scan.py`: prefer IB current quote when available, compare against Yahoo chart metadata, and fall back to Yahoo when IB diverges materially or is unavailable.
- Refreshed the served CRI artifacts by correcting [data/cri.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/data/cri.json) and writing a clean latest scheduled snapshot at [cri-2026-03-10T18-45.json](/Users/joemccann/dev/apps/finance/radon/data/cri_scheduled/cri-2026-03-10T18-45.json).
- Verified `pytest scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py -q` passes with `59/59`.
- Verified `npx playwright test e2e/regime-cor1m.spec.ts e2e/regime-cor1m-live-route.spec.ts` passes with `3/3`, including an unmocked `/regime` browser check against the live route.
- Verified the running dev server returns the corrected payload via `http://localhost:3000/api/regime`: `cor1m: 28.97`, `cor1m_5d_change: 6.88`, `cri.score: 25.4`.

## Session: CRI COR1M Refactor (2026-03-10)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Audit CRI data flow, frontend consumers, and repo-wide documentation references) depends_on: []
- T2 (Define COR1M fetch/calculation contract and write failing backend tests) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Implement backend CRI refactor from sector-ETF correlation to COR1M implied correlation) depends_on: [T2]

- T7 (Run verification, capture review notes, and summarize residual risks) depends_on: [T5, T6]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Audit CRI data flow, frontend consumers, and repo-wide documentation references
- [x] T2 Define COR1M fetch/calculation contract and write failing backend tests
- [x] T3 Implement backend CRI refactor from sector-ETF correlation to COR1M implied correlation
- [x] T4 Refactor frontend `/regime` consumers, labels, and API typing for COR1M
- [x] T5 Add or update browser E2E coverage for COR1M presentation and behavior
- [x] T6 Update all relevant docs, strategy references, site copy, and command/help surfaces
- [x] T7 Run verification, capture review notes, and summarize residual risks

### Review
- Confirmed red/green TDD: `pytest scripts/tests/test_cri_scan.py -q` failed on missing `cor1m_level_and_change`, then passed with 51/51 after the refactor.
- Confirmed browser automation against the running dev server: `npx playwright test e2e/regime-cor1m.spec.ts e2e/regime-market-closed-eod.spec.ts` passed with 9/9.
- Confirmed targeted `/regime` source-inspection tests pass after updating them to ESM-safe path handling: `npx tsx --test tests/regime-market-closed-values.test.ts tests/regime-market-closed.test.ts tests/regime-spy-subscription.test.ts`.
- Confirmed `cd web && npm run build` passes after the COR1M subscription and UI contract changes.
- Refreshed CRI cache artifacts with live COR1M data: `python3 scripts/cri_scan.py --json > data/cri.json` and wrote `data/cri_scheduled/cri-2026-03-10T17-21.json`.
- Residual risk: older scheduled CRI cache files still exist historically in `data/cri_scheduled/`; the app now has a fresh COR1M-shaped file, so current reads are correct.

## Session: Real-Time Option Contract Price Subscriptions (2026-03-03)

### Problem
IB realtime WS server only subscribed to stock contracts (`ib.contract.stock()`), so options positions (bear put spreads, bull call spreads, short puts) never received real-time price updates.

### Solution
Composite key scheme: stock prices keyed by ticker (`"AAPL"`), option prices by `{SYMBOL}_{YYYYMMDD}_{STRIKE}_{RIGHT}` (e.g., `"EWY_20260417_42_P"`). Both coexist in the same `Record<string, PriceData>` map.

### Checklist
- [x] Add shared types & utilities (`web/lib/pricesProtocol.ts`): `OptionContract`, `optionKey()`, `contractsKey()`, `portfolioLegToContract()`
- [x] Update IB server (`scripts/ib_realtime_server.js`): `normalizeContracts()`, refactored `startLiveSubscription(key, ibContract)`, option subscribe handler via `ib.contract.option()`
- [x] Update client hook (`web/lib/usePrices.ts`): `contracts` option, `contractHash` memoization, contracts in subscribe message
- [x] Extract contracts from portfolio (`web/components/WorkspaceShell.tsx`): `portfolioContracts` useMemo iterates non-Stock legs
- [x] Display real-time option prices (`web/components/WorkspaceSections.tsx`): `legPriceKey()`, real-time MV/daily-change for options, `LegRow` with WS prices

### Files Modified
- `web/lib/pricesProtocol.ts`
- `scripts/ib_realtime_server.js`
- `web/lib/usePrices.ts`
- `web/components/WorkspaceShell.tsx`
- `web/components/WorkspaceSections.tsx`

### Review
- TypeScript compilation passes (no errors in modified files)
- Server syntax check passes (`node --check`)
- Backward compatible: stock subscriptions unchanged, option contracts are additive

## Session: Combo Order Fixes + Leg P&L (2026-03-06)

### Checklist
- [x] Fix ModifyOrderModal BAG price resolution — pass `portfolio`, compute net BID/ASK/LAST from per-leg WS prices
- [x] Fix triplicate executed orders — replace `setInterval` with chained `setTimeout` in cancel/modify polling + dedupe safety net
- [x] Add per-leg P&L in expanded combo rows — `sign × (|MV| − |EC|)` with color coding
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md calculations + price resolution docs

### Files Modified
- `web/components/ModifyOrderModal.tsx`
- `web/components/WorkspaceSections.tsx`

## Session: Remote IBC Control + Cloud Hosting Research (2026-03-10)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Capture current local IBC architecture and control points) depends_on: []
- T2 (Research secure remote-control options for local IBC from iPhone) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Research cloud-hosted IBC deployment options and constraints) depends_on: [T1]
- T4 (Compare options and select recommendation ordering) depends_on: [T2, T3]
- T5 (Document implementation plan and review notes) depends_on: [T4]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Capture current local IBC architecture and control points
- [x] T2 Research secure remote-control options for local IBC from iPhone
- [x] T3 Research cloud-hosted IBC deployment options and constraints
- [x] T4 Compare options and select recommendation ordering
- [x] T5 Document implementation plan and review notes

### Review
- Verified the active local service is the machine-global `local.ibc-gateway` LaunchAgent, not the legacy repo-local `com.radon.ibc-gateway` path.
- Verified live control wrappers exist at `~/ibc/bin/start-secure-ibc-service.sh`, `stop-secure-ibc-service.sh`, `restart-secure-ibc-service.sh`, and `status-secure-ibc-service.sh`; each is a thin `launchctl` wrapper against `gui/$UID/local.ibc-gateway`.
- Verified the active runner `~/ibc/bin/run-secure-ibc-gateway.sh` loads credentials from macOS Keychain, writes a temporary `0600` runtime IBC config, and launches `ibcstart.sh` in Gateway mode.
- Best local remote-control recommendation: keep IBC on the Mac, add a private control plane over Tailscale, and trigger only the existing wrapper scripts remotely. Best UX variant is a small status/start/stop web endpoint exposed via Tailscale Serve and locked to the tailnet; lowest-effort variant is SSH over Tailscale from iPhone.
- Best cloud recommendation: move to a dedicated private Linux VM running IB Gateway + IBC, accessed only over VPN/private network. This remains operationally viable but outside IBKR's supported headless model, so weekly Sunday re-auth and strict network isolation remain mandatory.
- Secondary cloud options: QuantRocket if a broader managed IB stack is desirable; community Docker images only for operators already comfortable with containers, persistence, and private networking.

- Verified key content markers via `rg`.
- Opened the report locally with `open`.

## Session: Phase 1 Remote IBC Access Implementation (2026-03-10)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Inspect current Tailscale, SSH, and IBC control state on the Mac) depends_on: []
- T2 (Implement repo-local Phase 1 helper tooling around the existing secure IBC wrappers) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Persist future-facing markdown documentation referencing the HTML report) depends_on: [T2]
- T4 (Validate helper behavior and capture remaining manual system steps) depends_on: [T2, T3]

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Inspect current Tailscale, SSH, and IBC control state on the Mac
- [x] T2 Implement repo-local Phase 1 helper tooling around the existing secure IBC wrappers
- [x] T3 Persist future-facing markdown documentation referencing the HTML report
- [x] T4 Validate helper behavior and capture remaining manual system steps

### Review
- Verified the current Phase 1 shape uses standard macOS SSH over the Tailscale network, not Tailscale SSH server mode, because this Mac has the GUI app variant of Tailscale installed.
- Verified the canonical IBC service surface is the secure machine-local wrapper set in `~/ibc/bin/`; repo automation is documented as a convenience wrapper only.
- Added `scripts/ibc_remote_control.sh` as a repo-local helper for `check`, `tailscale-status`, `tailscale-login`, `ibc-status`, `ibc-start`, `ibc-stop`, `ibc-restart`, and `remote-help`.
- Added `docs/ibc-remote-access.md` as the durable markdown reference and linked it to `reports/ibc-remote-control-and-cloud-options-2026-03-10.html`.
- Added `tasks/lessons.md` to capture the correction that the secure machine-local `~/ibc/bin/*secure-ibc-service.sh` commands are the canonical service surface.
- Validation:
  - `./scripts/ibc_remote_control.sh check` confirmed Tailscale is connected, macOS SSH is enabled, and `local.ibc-gateway` is running.
  - `./scripts/ibc_remote_control.sh ibc-status` confirmed the secure `local.ibc-gateway` LaunchAgent is running.
  - `./scripts/ibc_remote_control.sh remote-help` prints both direct secure-service SSH commands and the optional repo convenience wrapper commands.
  - `nc -zv 127.0.0.1 22` confirmed the SSH listener is active.
  - Public-key SSH is not configured yet because `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` is absent; Phase 1 will therefore be password-based from the iPhone unless a client key is added later.
- Remaining optional step:
  - Add a dedicated SSH public key for the iPhone client if you want key-based login instead of password auth.

- Reworked `README.md` to match the requested structure from the shared review: cleaner summary, badges, explicit Inputs/Processing/Outputs, three-gate framework, strategy matrix, architecture diagram, grouped commands, simplified data-source/testing sections, example workflow, and the Phase 1 remote IBC dependency block.
- Updated the authoritative IBC docs in `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/implement.md`, and `docs/ib_tws_api.md` so the secure machine-local `~/ibc/bin/*secure-ibc-service.sh` commands are the primary surface and the old `scripts/setup_ibc.sh` flow is clearly legacy.
- Preserved and linked the Phase 1 remote-access runbook in `docs/ibc-remote-access.md`, including the concrete dependencies required for iPhone control:
  - `Tailscale.app` on the Mac
  - Tailscale on the iPhone, connected to the same tailnet
  - macOS `Remote Login`
  - iPhone SSH client such as Termius, Blink Shell, or Prompt
  - Optional SSH public key in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` for key-based login
- Validation:
  - `bash -n scripts/ibc_remote_control.sh` passed.
  - `./scripts/ibc_remote_control.sh remote-help` prints the direct secure-service SSH commands and optional helper commands.
  - User confirmed iPhone SSH login works in Termius with password auth.
  - Commit: `bf86cc4` (`docs: refresh README and document secure IBC remote access`)
  - Push: `origin/main` updated on `2026-03-10`

### Checklist
- [x] T1 Preserve the research baseline, report, and canonical secure local service surface
  - Success criteria:
    - `reports/ibc-remote-control-and-cloud-options-2026-03-10.html` remains the durable comparison artifact.
    - The canonical service surface is documented everywhere as `~/ibc/bin/*secure-ibc-service.sh`.
- [x] T2 Complete Phase 1 local SSH-over-Tailscale access and documentation
  - Success criteria:
    - iPhone can connect to the Mac over Tailscale and run the secure IBC commands.
    - README and runbook document the dependencies and direct command flow.
- [ ] T3 Harden local remote access with key-based SSH and tighter SSH policy
  - depends_on: [T2]
  - Success criteria:
    - iPhone SSH client uses a dedicated key instead of password auth.
    - `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` contains the intended client key only.
    - SSH config is reviewed so remote access remains limited to the Tailscale path and expected auth methods.
- [ ] T4 Build Phase 2 private web controller over Tailscale for start/stop/status/restart
  - depends_on: [T2]
  - Success criteria:
    - A minimal private controller runs only on the Mac.
    - It exposes `status`, `start`, `stop`, and `restart` for the secure local IBC service.
    - Access is restricted to the tailnet and does not expose IB API or IBC command ports publicly.
- [ ] T5 Add local resilience: health checks, alerting, and away-from-desk power/sleep policy
  - depends_on: [T3, T4]
  - Success criteria:
    - There is an operator-visible health signal for IBC reachability and launchd state.
    - Failure notifications or a simple alert path exist for the local service.
    - The machine’s sleep/power behavior is documented so remote control is reliable while away.
- [ ] T6 Stand up a private cloud IBC proof of concept on a Linux VM
  - depends_on: [T1]
  - Success criteria:
    - A private Linux VM runs IB Gateway + IBC with no public IB or VNC exposure.
    - Access is limited to Tailscale or equivalent private networking.
    - Secrets and persistent Gateway state are stored outside ad hoc local files.
- [ ] T7 Validate cloud persistence, secrets, restart behavior, and Sunday re-auth runbook
  - depends_on: [T6]
  - Success criteria:
    - The VM survives restart/redeploy without losing required Gateway/IBC state.
    - Weekly Sunday re-auth and recovery steps are documented and tested.
    - Burn-in covers reconnects, restart cadence, and failure handling for at least one trading week.
- [ ] T8 Decide primary operating model and cut over to the preferred steady-state path
  - depends_on: [T5, T7]
  - Success criteria:
    - There is an explicit decision between Mac-hosted primary and cloud-hosted primary.
    - The non-primary path is documented as fallback.
    - Final operator runbooks point to one canonical daily-use workflow.

### Review
- This session converts the prior research into an explicit end-to-end rollout instead of stopping at Phase 1.
- Current completed state:
  - Phase 1 local SSH-over-Tailscale access is working from the iPhone.
  - The secure machine-local `~/ibc/bin/*secure-ibc-service.sh` wrappers are the canonical service surface.
  - The durable research and reference artifacts already exist in `reports/ibc-remote-control-and-cloud-options-2026-03-10.html` and `docs/ibc-remote-access.md`.
- Remaining delivery is now split cleanly into two tracks:
  - Local track: SSH hardening, private web control plane, operational resilience.
  - Cloud track: private VM proof of concept, burn-in, and cutover decision.

## Session: Planned IBC Multi-Phase Rollout (2026-03-10)

### Dependency Graph
- T1 (Phase 2 local hardening: key-based SSH, access policy, and reachability decision) depends_on: []
- T2 (Phase 3 private tailnet web controller for status/start/stop/restart and health) depends_on: [T1]
- T3 (Phase 4 cloud pilot: private Linux VM running IB Gateway + IBC with persistent state and private access) depends_on: [T1]
- T4 (Phase 5 cloud burn-in: restart/reconnect validation, Sunday re-auth runbook, and monitoring) depends_on: [T3]
- T5 (Phase 6 deployment decision and cutover plan across local versus cloud primary) depends_on: [T2, T4]

### Checklist
- [ ] T1 Phase 2 local hardening: key-based SSH, access policy, and reachability decision
  - depends_on: []
  - Success criteria:
    - A dedicated iPhone SSH public key is installed in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
    - The preferred auth mode and remote-access policy are documented for the Mac.
    - A reachability policy is chosen and documented: keep-awake, wake relay, or accepted sleep limitation.

- [ ] T2 Phase 3 private tailnet web controller for status/start/stop/restart and health
  - depends_on: [T1]
  - Success criteria:
    - A private controller is reachable only from the tailnet.
    - The iPhone flow supports `status`, `start`, `stop`, and `restart` without shell interaction.
    - Basic health, recent logs, and failure feedback are visible remotely.

- [ ] T3 Phase 4 cloud pilot: private Linux VM running IB Gateway + IBC with persistent state and private access
  - depends_on: [T1]
  - Success criteria:
    - A private VM is provisioned with IB Gateway + IBC, Tailscale, persisted config/state, and secrets handling.
    - No IB API, IBC, VNC, or controller ports are exposed publicly.
    - Recovery access is defined for the VM when Gateway needs manual intervention.

- [ ] T4 Phase 5 cloud burn-in: restart/reconnect validation, Sunday re-auth runbook, and monitoring
  - depends_on: [T3]
  - Success criteria:
    - The cloud pilot survives a multi-day burn-in with successful reconnect behavior.
    - The Sunday re-auth and failure-recovery runbook is documented and validated.
    - Monitoring and log collection are sufficient to detect disconnects or stuck sessions.

- [ ] T5 Phase 6 deployment decision and cutover plan across local versus cloud primary
  - depends_on: [T2, T4]
  - Success criteria:
    - A primary deployment model is chosen: local Mac with private controller, cloud VM, or cloud pilot only.
    - Rollback and failover steps are documented for whichever model is selected.
    - The durable docs and future runbooks are updated to reflect the chosen operating model.

### Review
- Phase 1 is complete and operational: password-based macOS SSH over Tailscale to the secure `~/ibc/bin/*secure-ibc-service.sh` wrappers.
- The next local step is hardening, not replacing, the current path: add key-based SSH and make the Mac reachability policy explicit.
- The private web controller is the best Phase 3 UX improvement because it keeps the canonical service surface intact while removing the need for shell interaction on the phone.
- The cloud track should be treated as a pilot until a burn-in validates restart behavior, Sunday re-auth handling, and recovery procedures.
- If the cloud pilot remains operationally weaker than the local Mac because of IBKR auth friction, keep the local deployment as primary and treat cloud as a secondary or recovery path.
