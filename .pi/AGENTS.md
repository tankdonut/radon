# Convex Scavenger — Project Instructions

## ⚠️ Data Fetching Priority (ALWAYS follow this order)

When fetching ANY market data (quotes, options, fundamentals, analyst ratings, etc.):

| Priority | Source | When to Use |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **1st** | Interactive Brokers | Always try first if TWS/Gateway available |
| **2nd** | Unusual Whales | Flow data, dark pools, options activity |
| **3rd** | Yahoo Finance | Only if IB and UW unavailable/don't have the data |
| **4th** | Exa (web search) | Web search, company research, code/docs lookup |
| **5th** | agent-browser | Only for interactive pages, screenshots, JS-rendered content |

**Never skip to Yahoo Finance or web search without trying IB/UW first.**
**For web search/fetch: always use Exa first, agent-browser only as fallback.**

---

## ⚠️ Always Fetch Today's Data (Market Hours Rule)

**Before ANY analysis (scan, evaluation, LEAP scan, etc.), ALWAYS fetch fresh market data for today.**

This applies to:
- `scan` — Fetch today's dark pool flow before scoring
- `evaluate [TICKER]` — Fetch today's flow + options data
- `leap-scan` — Fetch today's spot prices and IV levels
- `discover` — Use today's flow alerts, not cached data
- `seasonal` — Combine with today's price action
- `analyst-ratings` — Fetch latest ratings (may have changed today)

**How to check if market is open:**
```bash
# US market hours: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET, Mon-Fri (excluding holidays)
# Check current time in ET
TZ=America/New_York date +"%A %H:%M"
```

**Rules:**
1. If market is **OPEN**: Fetch fresh data before analysis. Do not use cached/stale data.
2. If market is **CLOSED**: Use most recent available data. Note "Market closed — using last available data" in output.
3. For multi-ticker scans: Batch fetch where possible (e.g., UW flow-alerts endpoint supports multiple tickers).
4. Cache TTL during market hours: **5 minutes max** for flow data, **15 minutes** for analyst ratings.

**Implementation:**
- Scripts should check market status and log data freshness
- Include timestamp of data fetch in all analysis output
- If IB connection unavailable during market hours, fall back to UW/Yahoo but note the degraded state

## Workflow Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `scan` | Scan watchlist for dark pool flow signals |
| `discover` | Find new candidates from market-wide options flow |
| `evaluate [TICKER]` | Full 7-milestone evaluation |
| `portfolio` | **Generate HTML portfolio report and open in browser** |
| `free-trade` | Analyze positions for free trade opportunities |
| `journal` | View recent trade log entries |
| `sync` | Pull live portfolio from Interactive Brokers |
| `blotter` | Trade blotter - today's fills, P&L, spread grouping |

### Portfolio Command Details

When user runs `portfolio`, ALWAYS:
1. Sync latest data from IB (if connected)
2. Generate HTML report via `python3 scripts/portfolio_report.py`
3. Report opens automatically in browser
4. Output location: `reports/portfolio-{date}.html`

```bash
# Generate and open report
python3 scripts/portfolio_report.py

# Sync from IB first, then generate
python3 scripts/portfolio_report.py --sync

# Generate without opening
python3 scripts/portfolio_report.py --no-open
```

### Free Trade Command

Analyze multi-leg positions to find opportunities to close hedge legs profitably, making the core leg "free" (zero net cost).

```bash
# Full analysis of all positions
python3 scripts/free_trade_analyzer.py

# Filter by ticker
python3 scripts/free_trade_analyzer.py --ticker EWY

# Compact table format (used by startup protocol)
python3 scripts/free_trade_analyzer.py --table

# Brief one-line summary
python3 scripts/free_trade_analyzer.py --summary

# JSON output
python3 scripts/free_trade_analyzer.py --json
```

**Supported Structures:**
| Structure | Core Leg | Hedge Leg | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Synthetic Long | Long Call | Short Put | Same strike (behaves like stock) |
| Synthetic Short | Long Put | Short Call | Same strike (behaves like short stock) |
| Risk Reversal (Bullish) | Long Call | Short Put | Different strikes |
| Risk Reversal (Bearish) | Long Put | Short Call | Different strikes |
| Bull Call Spread | Long Call (lower) | Short Call (higher) | |
| Bear Put Spread | Long Put (higher) | Short Put (lower) | |

**Output Metrics:**
- **Effective Core Cost**: Core entry cost - Hedge P&L
- **Progress to Free**: Percentage of core cost covered by hedge profit
- **Breakeven Close Price**: Price to close hedge to make core free

**Progress Status Icons:**
| Icon | Status | Progress |
|------|--------|----------|
| 🎉 FREE | Position is free | 100% |
| ⚡ Near | Near free | ≥50% |
| 🔄 Progress | Making progress | 25-49% |
| ⏳ Early | Early stage | <25% |

**Startup Integration:**
- Runs automatically on Pi startup
- Shows ALL multi-leg positions in compact table format
- Table includes: Ticker, Progress %, Status icon

| `blotter-history` | Historical trades via Flex Query (requires setup) |
| `leap-scan [TICKERS]` | Scan for LEAP IV mispricing opportunities |
| `garch-convergence [TICKERS]` | Cross-asset GARCH vol divergence scan |
| `seasonal [TICKERS]` | Seasonality assessment for one or more tickers |
| `x-scan [@ACCOUNT]` | Fetch tweets via xAI API (recommended, slower) |
| `x-scan-browser [@ACCOUNT]` | Fetch tweets via browser scraping (faster, lower quality) |
| `analyst-ratings [TICKERS]` | Fetch analyst ratings, changes, and price targets |

## Evaluation Milestones

Always follow in order. Stop immediately if a gate fails.

1. **Validate Ticker** → `python3 scripts/fetch_ticker.py [TICKER]`
1B. **Seasonality** → Fetch & analyze (does not affect score, but report in analysis)
1C. **Analyst Ratings** → `python3 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py [TICKER]` (context, not a gate)
2. **Dark Pool Flow** → `python3 scripts/fetch_flow.py [TICKER]`
3. **Options Flow** → `python3 scripts/fetch_options.py [TICKER]`
4. **Edge Decision** → PASS/FAIL with reasoning (stop if FAIL)
5. **Structure** → Design convex position (stop if R:R < 2:1)
6. **Kelly Sizing** → Calculate + enforce caps
7. **Log Trade** → Append executed trades only to trade_log.json (NO_TRADE decisions go to status.md)

## Seasonality Data

Fetch monthly performance data from EquityClock:
```bash
curl -s -o /tmp/{TICKER}_sheet.png "https://charts.equityclock.com/seasonal_charts/{TICKER}_sheet.png"
```

**Rating Criteria:**
| Rating | Win Rate | Avg Return |
|--------|----------|------------|
| FAVORABLE | >60% | >5% |
| NEUTRAL | 50-60% | 0-5% |
| UNFAVORABLE | <50% | <0% |

Seasonality is CONTEXT, not a gate. Strong flow can override weak seasonality, but weak flow + weak seasonality = pass.

## X Account Scan

Two methods to fetch tweets and extract ticker sentiment:

### Method 1: xAI API (Recommended)

Uses xAI's Grok with x_search tool for high-quality analysis.

```bash
# Scan default account (@aleabitoreddit)
python3 scripts/fetch_x_xai.py

# Scan specific account
python3 scripts/fetch_x_xai.py --account elonmusk

# Look back 7 days
python3 scripts/fetch_x_xai.py --days 7

# Dry run (don't update watchlist)
python3 scripts/fetch_x_xai.py --dry-run

# Raw JSON output
python3 scripts/fetch_x_xai.py --json
```

**Requires:** `XAI_API_KEY` environment variable

**Pros:** High quality sentiment analysis, source citations, detailed explanations
**Cons:** Slow (2-3 minutes), may timeout under load

### Method 2: Browser Scraping (Fallback)

Uses browser automation to scrape X profile pages.

```bash
# Scan default account
python3 scripts/fetch_x_watchlist.py

# Scan specific account  
python3 scripts/fetch_x_watchlist.py --account elonmusk
```

**Requires:** `agent-browser` CLI

**Pros:** Faster, no API limits
**Cons:** Lower quality parsing, limited context, sentiment less reliable

### Startup Protocol

- Browser scraper runs on **every startup** for all X accounts in watchlist
- Runs asynchronously (non-blocking)
- Shows tweet count when complete: `@account: N tweets`
- For high-quality analysis, run `x-scan` manually

**Output:**
- Extracts tickers mentioned in tweets (via $TICKER cashtags)
- Determines sentiment: BULLISH / BEARISH / NEUTRAL
- Rates confidence: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
- Updates watchlist subcategory with new/updated tickers

---

## Options Flow Command

Fetch options chain activity and institutional flow alerts.

**Data Sources (following standard priority):**
1. Interactive Brokers - spot price, expirations, strikes
2. Unusual Whales - chain volume/premium, flow alerts, sweeps (primary)
3. Yahoo Finance - fallback for basic chain data

```bash
# Standard analysis
python3 scripts/fetch_options.py RMBS

# JSON output for programmatic use
python3 scripts/fetch_options.py RMBS --json

# Force specific data source
python3 scripts/fetch_options.py RMBS --source uw
python3 scripts/fetch_options.py RMBS --source ib
python3 scripts/fetch_options.py RMBS --source yahoo

# Custom IB port
python3 scripts/fetch_options.py RMBS --port 7497

# Filter by DTE
python3 scripts/fetch_options.py RMBS --dte-min 14 --dte-max 60
```

**Output Includes:**

*Chain Activity:*
- Call/Put premium breakdown
- Volume and open interest
- Bid-side vs ask-side volume (buyer/seller pressure)
- Top active contracts with IV
- Put/Call ratio and chain bias

*Institutional Flow Alerts:*
- Recent flow alerts (sweeps, blocks, unusual activity)
- Bid-side (selling) vs ask-side (buying) premium
- Sweep premium (urgency indicator)
- Flow bias and strength score (0-100)

*Combined Analysis:*
- Chain bias + Flow bias synthesis
- Conflict detection (when signals disagree)
- Confidence rating: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

**Bias Interpretation:**

| Put/Call Ratio | Bias |
|----------------|------|
| >2.0x | BEARISH |
| 1.2-2.0x | LEAN_BEARISH |
| 0.8-1.2x | NEUTRAL |
| 0.5-0.8x | LEAN_BULLISH |
| <0.5x | BULLISH |

**Flow Side Meaning:**
- **Bid-side dominant**: Trades at/below mid = selling pressure (closing longs OR opening shorts)
- **Ask-side dominant**: Trades at/above mid = buying pressure (opening longs)

Options flow is used to CONFIRM or CONTRADICT dark pool signals. Conflicting chain/flow signals reduce confidence.

---

## Analyst Ratings Command

Fetch analyst ratings, recent rating changes, and price targets.

**Data Sources (following standard priority):**
1. Interactive Brokers (`RESC` fundamental data) - requires Reuters subscription
2. Yahoo Finance - fallback if IB unavailable (rate limited)
3. Web scrape - last resort

*Note: Unusual Whales HAS analyst ratings via `/api/screener/analysts` endpoint. See `docs/unusual_whales_api.md` for details.*

```bash
# Scan specific tickers (auto-detects IB, falls back to Yahoo)
python3 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py AAPL MSFT NVDA

# Scan all watchlist tickers
python3 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py --watchlist

# Scan all portfolio positions
python3 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py --portfolio

# Scan both watchlist and portfolio
python3 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py --all

# Only show tickers with recent changes (upgrades/downgrades)
python3 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py --portfolio --changes-only

# Update watchlist.json with analyst rating data
python3 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py --watchlist --update-watchlist

# Force specific data source
python3 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py AAPL --source yahoo
python3 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py AAPL --source ib

# Custom IB port
python3 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py --portfolio --port 7497

# Bypass cache
python3 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py AAPL --no-cache

# Output raw JSON
python3 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py AAPL --json
```

**Output Includes:**
- Recommendation (Strong Buy → Sell)
- Buy/Hold/Sell percentage breakdown
- Analyst count (confidence indicator)
- Mean price target and upside/downside %
- Recent rating distribution changes
- Upgrade/downgrade history (firm, action, date)

**Signal Interpretation:**

| Buy % | Direction | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| ≥70% | BULLISH | Strong consensus |
| 50-69% | LEAN_BULLISH | Positive bias |
| 30-49% | LEAN_BEARISH | Negative bias |
| <30% | BEARISH | Strong negative consensus |

| Analyst Count | Confidence |
|---------------|------------|
| ≥20 | HIGH |
| 10-19 | MEDIUM |
| <10 | LOW |

**Changes Signal:**
- `UPGRADING` — Net increase in Buy/Strong Buy ratings
- `DOWNGRADING` — Net increase in Sell/Strong Sell ratings

Analyst ratings are CONTEXT, not a gate. Use for:
- Confirming or questioning flow signals
- Identifying contrarian opportunities (strong flow vs. weak ratings)
- Monitoring positions for sentiment shifts

---

## Seasonal Command

Usage: `seasonal [TICKER]` or `seasonal [TICKER1] [TICKER2] ...`

**Process:**
1. Download chart: `curl -s -o /tmp/{TICKER}_sheet.png "https://charts.equityclock.com/seasonal_charts/{TICKER}_sheet.png"`
2. Read image and extract monthly data table
3. Identify current month and next 2-3 months
4. Assign rating (FAVORABLE / NEUTRAL / UNFAVORABLE)
5. Output summary table with actionable context

**Output includes:**
- Current month: win rate, avg return, max, min
- Next 2-3 months outlook (for hold-through scenarios)
- Best/worst months of year
- Rating with reasoning

---

## Trade Blotter Command

Fetch and reconcile trades from Interactive Brokers. Calculates P&L deterministically including all commissions/fees.

```bash
# Today's trades with spread grouping
python3 scripts/blotter.py

# P&L summary only
python3 scripts/blotter.py --summary

# JSON output for programmatic use
python3 scripts/blotter.py --json

# Show execution details
python3 scripts/blotter.py --verbose

# Custom IB port
python3 scripts/blotter.py --port 7497
```

**Output Includes:**
- All today's fills grouped by contract
- Spread identification (put spreads, call spreads, risk reversals)
- Combined P&L for multi-leg spreads
- Commission totals
- Open vs closed position status

**Spread Types Detected:**
| Pattern | Name |
|---------|------|
| Long higher strike put + Short lower strike put | Put Spread |
| Short higher strike put + Long lower strike put | Put Spread (Bull) |
| Long call + Short call (same expiry) | Call Spread |
| Short put + Long call (same expiry) | Risk Reversal |
| Long put + Short call (same expiry) | Collar |

**P&L Calculation:**
- Cash flow = notional value ± commission (buy = negative, sell = positive)
- Realized P&L = sum of all cash flows for closed positions
- Commissions are always subtracted from cash flow
- All calculations use Decimal for precision

**Integration Tests:**
```bash
python3 scripts/trade_blotter/test_integration.py
```

---

## Monitor Daemon Service

A single extensible daemon that handles all background monitoring tasks.

### Handlers

| Handler | Interval | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `fill_monitor` | 60s | Detect order fills, send notifications |
| `exit_orders` | 300s | Place pending exit orders when IB accepts them |

### Commands

```bash
# Status
python3 -m monitor_daemon.run --status

# Run once (for testing)
python3 -m monitor_daemon.run --once

# Run as daemon
python3 -m monitor_daemon.run --daemon

# List available handlers
python3 -m monitor_daemon.run --list-handlers
```

### Service Management

```bash
# Install launchd service (runs every 60s during market hours)
./scripts/setup_monitor_daemon.sh install

# Check status
./scripts/setup_monitor_daemon.sh status

# View logs
./scripts/setup_monitor_daemon.sh logs

# Test run
./scripts/setup_monitor_daemon.sh test

# Uninstall
./scripts/setup_monitor_daemon.sh uninstall
```

### Adding New Handlers

1. Create `scripts/monitor_daemon/handlers/my_handler.py`
2. Inherit from `BaseHandler`
3. Implement `execute()` method
4. Register in `run.py` `create_daemon()`

Example:
```python
from monitor_daemon.handlers.base import BaseHandler

class MyHandler(BaseHandler):
    name = "my_handler"
    interval_seconds = 120  # Run every 2 minutes
    
    def execute(self) -> dict:
        # Your monitoring logic here
        return {"status": "ok", "data": {...}}
```

### State Persistence

Handler state (last run times, known orders) is saved to:
```
data/daemon_state.json
```

### Logs

```
logs/monitor-daemon.log      # Main daemon log
logs/monitor-daemon.out.log  # launchd stdout
logs/monitor-daemon.err.log  # launchd stderr
```

## Flex Query Setup (Historical Trades)

The real-time IB API only provides **today's fills**. To calculate P&L for positions opened/closed on previous days, you need to set up IB Flex Query for historical data.

### One-Time Setup

**Step 1: Login to IB Account Management**
```
https://www.interactivebrokers.com/sso/Login
```

**Step 2: Create a Flex Query**
1. Navigate to: **Reports → Flex Queries**
2. Click **"+ Create"** under "Activity Flex Query"
3. Configure:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Query Name | `Trade History` |
| **Sections** | ☑️ Trades, ☑️ Commission Details |
| Format | `XML` |
| Period | `Last 365 Calendar Days` |
| Breakout by Day | `Yes` |

4. Click **Continue**
5. In Trades section, select **ALL fields** (or at minimum: Symbol, DateTime, Buy/Sell, Quantity, TradePrice, Commission, Strike, Expiry, Put/Call, TradeID)
6. Click **Save**
7. Note the **Query ID** displayed (e.g., `1422766`)

**Step 3: Get Flex Web Service Token**
1. Navigate to: **Reports → Settings → Flex Web Service**
2. Click **Generate Token**
3. Note the token string

**Step 4: Configure Environment**
Add to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:
```bash
export IB_FLEX_TOKEN="your_token_here"
export IB_FLEX_QUERY_ID="your_query_id_here"
```

Then reload:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Usage

```bash
# Fetch all historical trades
python3 scripts/trade_blotter/flex_query.py

# Filter by symbol
python3 scripts/trade_blotter/flex_query.py --symbol EWY

# JSON output
python3 scripts/trade_blotter/flex_query.py --json

# Pass credentials directly (if not using env vars)
python3 scripts/trade_blotter/flex_query.py --token YOUR_TOKEN --query-id YOUR_QUERY_ID

# Show setup guide
python3 scripts/trade_blotter/flex_query.py --setup
```

### What Flex Query Provides

| Data | Real-time API | Flex Query |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Today's fills | ✅ | ✅ |
| Historical fills (1-365 days) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Commission details | ✅ | ✅ |
| Open/Close indicator | ❌ | ✅ |
| Trade ID for reconciliation | ✅ | ✅ |

---

## Output Format

- Always show: signal → structure → Kelly math → decision
- State probability estimates explicitly, flag uncertainty
- When a trade doesn't meet criteria, say so immediately with the failing gate
- Never rationalize a bad trade
- Log EXECUTED trades to trade_log.json
- Log NO_TRADE decisions to docs/status.md (Recent Evaluations section)

## Trade Specification Reports ⭐ REQUIRED

**When recommending ANY trade, ALWAYS generate a Trade Specification HTML report.**

```bash
# Template location
.pi/skills/html-report/trade-specification-template.html

# Output location
reports/{ticker}-evaluation-{DATE}.html

# Example
reports/goog-evaluation-2026-03-04.html
```

**This is MANDATORY for:**
- Any `evaluate [TICKER]` that reaches the Structure milestone
- Any trade recommendation before execution
- Any position proposal requiring user confirmation

**Required sections (10 total):**
1. Header with ticker, company, price, gate status (ALL GATES PASSED / FAILED)
2. Summary Metrics (6): signal score, buy ratio, flow strength, convexity, position size, max gain
3. Milestone Summary with pass/fail status for all 7 milestones
4. Dark Pool Flow Section: daily breakdown + aggregate analysis
5. Options Flow Section: chain bias, institutional flow, combined signal
6. Context Section: seasonality + analyst ratings
7. Structure & Kelly: position structure and Kelly sizing
8. Trade Specification: exact order details ready for execution
9. Thesis & Risk Factors callouts
10. Three Gates Summary table

**Reference implementation:** `reports/goog-evaluation-2026-03-04.html`

**Workflow:**
1. Complete evaluation milestones 1-6
2. Generate HTML report with all data
3. Present to user for confirmation
4. On "execute" → place order via IB
5. On fill → update trade_log.json, portfolio.json, status.md

## P&L Reports

**When generating any P&L report, ALWAYS use the P&L template:**

```bash
# Template location
.pi/skills/html-report/pnl-template.html

# Output location
reports/pnl-{TICKER}-{DATE}.html
```

**Required sections for every P&L report:**
1. Header with CLOSED/OPEN status pill
2. 4 metrics: Realized P&L, Commissions, Hold Period, Return on Risk
3. Trade Summary callout (strategy, thesis, outcome)
4. Execution table(s) with cash flows per leg
5. Combined P&L panel (for spreads)
6. Trade timeline
7. Footer with data source

**Return on Risk formula:**
```
Return on Risk = Realized P&L / Capital at Risk

Capital at Risk:
  - Debit spread: Net debit paid
  - Credit spread: Max loss (width - credit)
  - Long option: Premium paid
  - Stock: Cost basis
```

See `.pi/skills/html-report/SKILL.md` for full template documentation.

## ⚠️ Order Execution (CRITICAL)

**When placing ANY order, ALWAYS use `ib_execute.py`.**

This script automatically:
1. Places the order
2. Monitors for fills (real-time)
3. Logs filled trades to `trade_log.json`

**NEVER place orders manually without monitoring and logging.**

### Stock Orders
```bash
# Sell stock
python3 scripts/ib_execute.py --type stock --symbol NFLX --qty 4500 --side SELL --limit 98.70 --yes

# Buy stock
python3 scripts/ib_execute.py --type stock --symbol AAPL --qty 100 --side BUY --limit BID --yes
```

### Option Orders
```bash
# Buy call at mid
python3 scripts/ib_execute.py --type option --symbol GOOG --expiry 20260417 --strike 315 --right C --qty 10 --side BUY --limit MID --yes

# Sell put
python3 scripts/ib_execute.py --type option --symbol GOOG --expiry 20260417 --strike 290 --right P --qty 5 --side SELL --limit 3.50 --yes
```

### Limit Price Options
| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `MID` | Use current mid price |
| `BID` | Use current bid price |
| `ASK` | Use current ask price |
| `9.50` | Use exact price |

| `--no-log` | Don't log to trade_log.json |
| `--thesis "..."` | Add thesis to log entry |
| `--notes "..."` | Add notes to log entry |

## Interactive Brokers Integration

### Client ID Strategy

**Default to `clientId=0` (master client)** for full order control.

| clientId | Privileges | Scripts |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **0** (master) | Can cancel/modify ANY order | `ib_sync`, `ib_orders`, `ib_reconcile`, `ib_order_manage` |
| 2+ (unique) | Can only manage own orders | `ib_order`, `ib_fill_monitor`, `exit_order_service`, `ib_realtime_server` |

**Why master client:**
- Can cancel orders placed via TWS (which have `orderId=0`)
- Full visibility into all account orders
- Required for `ib_order_manage.py` cancel/modify operations

**When to use unique clientId:**
- Long-running services (streaming, monitoring) that shouldn't block other connections
- Order placement (tags orders with clientId for tracking)
- Multiple concurrent connections required

**Critical:** Only ONE connection can use `clientId=0` at a time.

### Portfolio Sync (Periodic)

```bash
# Display live portfolio (requires TWS/Gateway running)
python3 scripts/ib_sync.py

# Sync to portfolio.json
python3 scripts/ib_sync.py --sync

# Connect to different ports
python3 scripts/ib_sync.py --port 7496   # TWS Live
python3 scripts/ib_sync.py --port 7497   # TWS Paper (default)
python3 scripts/ib_sync.py --port 4001   # IB Gateway Live
python3 scripts/ib_sync.py --port 4002   # IB Gateway Paper
```

### Startup Protocol (Full Visibility)

When Pi starts, the startup extension (`.pi/extensions/startup-protocol.ts`) runs all checks with **numbered progress indicators**:

**Example output:**
```
🚀 Startup: Running 5 checks...
[1/5] ✓ Loaded: Spec, Plans, Runbook, Status, Context Engineering
[2/5] ✓ IB trades in sync
[3/5] ✓ Monitor daemon running
[4/5] ✓ Free Trade Progress:
       AAOI: 57% ⚡ Near
       EWY: 52% ⚡ Near
       IGV: 49% 🔄 Progress
       BKD: 16% ⏳ Early
       GOOG: 1% ⏳ Early
[5/5] ✓ @aleabitoreddit: scanned 0.7h ago
✅ Startup complete (5/5 passed)
```

**X Account Scan:**
- Runs automatically on **every startup**
- Output: `@account: N tickers` — Number of tickers found in recent tweets

**Processes tracked (in order):**

| # | Process | Type | Description |
|---|---------|------|-------------|
| 1 | `docs` | sync | Load project docs + always-on skills |
| 2 | `ib` | async | IB trade reconciliation (runs first, updates portfolio) |
| 3 | `free_trade` | async | Free trade scan (waits for IB to complete) |
| 4 | `daemon` | sync | Monitor daemon status check |
| 5+ | `x_{account}` | async | X account scans (parallel with above) |

**Note:** Free trade analysis depends on IB sync because closed positions affect which multi-leg positions exist.

**Status indicators:**
- `✓` — Success
- `⚠️` — Warning (skipped or issue)
- `❌` — Error (failed)

**Final summary:**
- `✅ Startup complete (N/N passed)` — All processes succeeded
- `⚠️ Startup complete (X/N passed, Y warnings)` — Some warnings
- `❌ Startup complete (X/N passed, Y failed)` — Some failures

**Implementation:** Uses `StartupTracker` class with 14 TDD tests.

**Test the startup protocol:**
```bash
npx tsx .pi/tests/startup-protocol.test.ts
```

### Startup Reconciliation (Automatic)

When Pi starts, the startup extension automatically runs `ib_reconcile.py` **asynchronously** (non-blocking) to detect:

1. **New trades** — Executions in IB not logged in `trade_log.json`
2. **New positions** — Positions in IB not in `portfolio.json`
3. **Closed positions** — Positions in `portfolio.json` no longer in IB

**How it works:**
- Runs in background via `spawn()` — does not block Pi startup
- Connects to IB Gateway/TWS (port 4001 by default)
- Compares IB executions and positions to local files
- Writes results to `data/reconciliation.json`
- Shows notification if reconciliation needed

**Notifications (via StartupTracker):**
- `[N/M] ✓ IB trades in sync` — No discrepancies found
- `[N/M] ⚠️ IB: 3 new trades, 1 closed position` — Action needed
- `[N/M] ⚠️ IB not connected (skipped)` — IB unavailable

**Manual run:**
```bash
python3 scripts/ib_reconcile.py
```

**Reconciliation report:**
```bash
cat data/reconciliation.json | python3 -m json.tool
```

**Actions detected:**
| Action | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| BUY | Opened long stock position |
| SELL | Closed long position (realized P&L) |
| SHORT | Opened short stock position |
| COVER | Closed short position |
| BUY_OPTION | Bought to open option |
| SELL_OPTION | Sold to close option |
| CLOSED | Position fully closed (net zero) |

### Exit Order Service (Automatic)

Monitors positions with pending manual exit orders and places them when IB will accept them. Runs automatically at Pi startup and can run as a periodic service.

**Background:** IB rejects limit orders that are too far from current market price (typically >40% away). This service monitors pending target exit orders and places them when the spread price gets close enough.

**Startup behavior:**
- Runs automatically when Pi starts (via `startup-protocol.ts`)
- Checks all positions with `PENDING_MANUAL` exit orders
- Attempts to place orders if spread is within 40% of target
- Notifies if any orders are placed

**Manual commands:**
```bash
# Check status of pending orders
python3 scripts/exit_order_service.py --status

# Run single check (place orders if possible)
python3 scripts/exit_order_service.py

# Dry run (preview without placing)
python3 scripts/exit_order_service.py --dry-run

# Run as daemon (every 5 mins during market hours)
python3 scripts/exit_order_service.py --daemon
```

**Periodic execution (launchd):**
```bash
# Install as macOS launchd service (runs every 5 minutes)
./scripts/setup_exit_order_service.sh install

# Check service status
./scripts/setup_exit_order_service.sh status

# View logs
./scripts/setup_exit_order_service.sh logs

# Uninstall service
./scripts/setup_exit_order_service.sh uninstall
```

**Log location:** `logs/exit-order-service.out.log`

**How it determines when to place:**
- Current spread price × 1.40 = Maximum placeable target
- Example: If spread is at $9.00, can place orders up to $12.60
- Orders farther away wait until spread appreciates

**Trade log integration:**
- Reads `exit_orders.target.status == "PENDING_MANUAL"` from trade_log.json
- Updates status to "ACTIVE" with `order_id` when placed

### Real-Time Price Streaming

Separate from portfolio sync - streams live prices via WebSocket.

```bash
# Start the real-time price server
# Start the Node.js realtime server from the web package
node ../web/scripts/ib_realtime_server.js

# Custom ports
node ../web/scripts/ib_realtime_server.js --port 8765 --ib-port 4001

# Test connectivity
python3 scripts/test_ib_realtime.py
python3 scripts/test_ib_realtime.py --ib-only   # Test IB only
python3 scripts/test_ib_realtime.py --ws-only   # Test WebSocket only
```

**WebSocket Protocol:**
```json
// Subscribe to symbols
{"action": "subscribe", "symbols": ["AAPL", "MSFT"]}

// Unsubscribe
{"action": "unsubscribe", "symbols": ["AAPL"]}

// One-time snapshot
{"action": "snapshot", "symbols": ["NVDA"]}

// Server sends price updates
{"type": "price", "symbol": "AAPL", "data": {"last": 175.50, "bid": 175.48, ...}}
```

**Next.js Integration:**
- API Route: `POST /api/prices` for one-time snapshot (body `{ "symbols": [...] }`)
- `GET /api/prices` is deprecated (`405`) and does not stream real-time data.
- Live pricing is end-to-end on Node via websocket; Next.js does not proxy live frames.
- React Hook: `usePrices({ symbols: ["AAPL", "MSFT"] })`

**Setup:**
1. Install project dependencies (`npm install` in `/web`) for the Node websocket server.
2. For IB + websocket connectivity tests, keep Python deps installed as needed (example: `pip install ib_insync websockets`).
3. In TWS: Configure → API → Settings → Enable "ActiveX and Socket Clients"
4. Ensure "Read-Only API" is unchecked if you want order capability later
