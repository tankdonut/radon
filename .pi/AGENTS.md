# Radon — Project Instructions

## ⛔ Radon Brand Identity — Mandatory for ALL UI & Asset Work

**Any change touching UI code, components, styles, layouts, modals, charts, empty states, system messages, or visual assets MUST comply with the Radon Brand Identity. Violations are blocking failures.**

**Reference files:**
- `docs/brand-identity.md` — Design system reference (quick lookup)
- `brand/radon-brand-system.md` — Complete brand specification (9 sections)
- `brand/radon-design-tokens.json` — Machine-readable design tokens
- `brand/radon-tailwind-theme.ts` — Tailwind CSS theme extension
- `brand/radon-component-kit.html` — Live component reference (panels, badges, tables, motifs)
- `brand/radon-terminal-mockup.html` — Full terminal layout mockup
- Logo assets: `brand/radon-app-icon.svg`, `radon-monogram.svg`, `radon-wordmark.svg`, `radon-lockup-horizontal.svg` | **Hero:** `.github/hero.png`

**Non-negotiable rules (read full spec before any UI work):**
- **Flagship accent:** `signal.core: #05AD98` (teal) — the core Radon discovery color
- **Surfaces:** `bg.canvas: #0a0f14` | `bg.panel: #0f1519` | `bg.panelRaised: #151c22` | `line.grid: #1e293b`
- **Typography:** Inter (UI/titles/labels/metrics) + IBM Plex Mono (dense numeric tables, status/meta telemetry) + Söhne (display/wordmark only)
- **4px max** `border-radius` on panels; badges use `999px` capsule — no soft consumer rounding
- **Signal semantics use clarity scale**, not P&L: Baseline → Emerging → Clear → Strong → Dislocated → Extreme
- Panels are instrument modules: hairline borders, matte surfaces, device-label headers, metadata rails
- Grid: 8px base unit, 4px micro, 16px gutters, 32px section gaps
- Brand voice: precise, calm, scientific — no hype, no emojis, no emotional punctuation
- No glassmorphism, heavy gradients, soft shadows, or decorative elements
- Empty states describe measurement conditions, not generic placeholders

## ⚠️ Bug Fix Workflow — Mandatory

**Red/green TDD for every bug fix, no exceptions:**

1. Write a failing test that reproduces the bug (test must be RED before any code change)
2. Implement the minimal fix
3. Confirm the test turns GREEN
4. For UI bugs: add a Playwright E2E test — unit tests alone are not sufficient confirmation

## ⚠️ Browser Verification — Mandatory

**For UI work in Codex instruction surfaces:**

1. **Visually verify rendered UI before calling the change done.**
   - Do not assume code changes produced the intended result.
   - Confirm the actual browser rendering after the patch.
2. **Preferred verification order:**
   - Primary: `chrome-cdp` when the skill is available in the current Codex runtime.
   - Fallback: Playwright using the repo configs in `web/`.
3. **If `chrome-cdp` is unavailable in the current runtime, Codex must fall back to Playwright.**
   - Do not write instructions that assume `chrome-cdp` exists in every host environment.

## ⚠️ Coverage Expectation — Mandatory

1. **Every change includes corresponding tests.**
2. **Target 95% coverage on the touched surface when practical.**
   - This is a project expectation, not a reason to pad changes with irrelevant tests.
   - The required bar is strong regression coverage for the behavior that changed.

## ⚠️ Options Chain Combo Entry Rules — Mandatory

**For IB combo/BAG orders entered from the options chain or any order builder:**

1. **Do not derive BAG `Order.action` from net debit vs net credit.**
   - IB combo leg actions define the structure.
   - A `SELL` BAG envelope reverses the spread legs.
   - For entry/open combo orders from the chain builder, keep the combo envelope on `BUY` and preserve the intended per-leg `BUY`/`SELL` actions.
2. **Reset top-level manual net price state when the combo structure changes.**
   - Adding a second leg, removing a leg, flipping a leg action, or otherwise changing the structure must invalidate stale top-level manual net pricing.
   - The limit field must re-base to the normalized combo quote for the current structure.
3. **Regression coverage is required at two levels.**
   - Unit coverage for payload semantics: combo action, ratio normalization, and net-price math.
   - Browser coverage for the rendered net price and submitted payload after a structure change.
4. **Trace combo-order bugs through the full placement path before patching.**
   - Inspect the frontend builder, Next route, FastAPI bridge, and `scripts/ib_place_order.py` so IB semantics are not misdiagnosed as a UI-only issue.

## ⚠️ Credit/Debit Sign Convention — Mandatory

**Preserve the sign throughout the entire display pipeline.** Never use `Math.abs()` or equivalent on option prices/values without explicit approval. Credits must display as negative, debits as positive. This applies to P&L cards, share images, order forms, and all price displays.

## ⚠️ Combo Natural Market Bid/Ask — Mandatory

**Always use cross-fields for natural market pricing. Never `sign * bid` and `sign * ask`.**

```
To BUY combo:  pay ASK on BUY legs, receive BID on SELL legs
To SELL combo: receive BID on BUY legs, pay ASK on SELL legs
```

**Example (bull call spread: BUY $200C @ bid=4.50/ask=4.70, SELL $210C @ bid=2.00/ask=2.20):**
- netAsk (cost to BUY) = 4.70 - 2.00 = 2.70
- netBid (proceeds to SELL) = 4.50 - 2.20 = 2.30
- mid = 2.50

**WRONG (mid-mid bug):** `sign * bid` = 4.50 - 2.00 = 2.50, `sign * ask` = 4.70 - 2.20 = 2.50 → bid = ask = mid ❌

**Implementations:** `computeNetOptionQuote()`, `ComboOrderForm.netPrices`, `resolveOrderPriceData()` for BAG.

## ⚠️ Options Structure Catalog — Reference

**Canonical file:** `docs/options-structures.json` | **Human reference:** `docs/options-structures.md`

58 structures across 12 categories. Use for:
- Order entry: structure classification, default leg actions, bias labels
- P&L attribution: risk profile (`defined`/`undefined`), max gain/loss formulas
- Naked short guard: `guard_decision` + `guard_correct` fields per structure

**Guard decision quick-reference:**
```
Combo (BAG) orders — checked before BUY early-return (IB BAG always uses BUY envelope):
  Combo closing (action=SELL)          → ALLOW  (reduces exposure)
  sellCallRatio == buyCallRatio         → ALLOW  (vertical spread / Jade Lizard / Seagull)
  sellCallRatio > buyCallRatio          → check stock (BLOCK if uncovered)
  Only SELL put legs, no SELL calls    → ALLOW  (cash-secured)

Single-leg:
  BUY anything                         → ALLOW
  SELL put                             → ALLOW  (cash-secured)
  SELL call, stock covers              → ALLOW  (covered call)
  SELL call, naked                     → BLOCK
  SELL stock, shares ≥ qty             → ALLOW
  SELL stock, naked                    → BLOCK
```

**All gaps resolved 2026-03-18** (`web/lib/nakedShortGuard.ts`):
- Short Risk Reversal (SELL C + BUY P): now correctly **BLOCK** unless stock-covered
- 1x2 ratio spread (BUY 1C + SELL 2C): now correctly **BLOCK** for uncovered call
- Jade Lizard / Seagull: correctly **ALLOW** (call spread is covered; were false positives)
- 21 unit tests passing (see `web/tests/naked-short-guard.test.ts`, tests 14–20)

---

## ⚠️ Order Placement Input Validation

`/api/orders/place` rejects before sending to IB:
- Zero or negative `quantity` → 400
- Zero or negative `limitPrice` → 400
- Non-finite numbers (NaN, Infinity) → 400
- Missing required fields → 400

## ⚠️ Order Cancel / Modify Failure Propagation

**For IB order cancel/modify bugs, trace and preserve the real failure boundary.**

1. **Do not trust the original IB `Trade` object as the sole confirmation source.**
   - IB can acknowledge a cancel by removing the order from refreshed open orders instead of mutating the original `Trade` instance in place.
   - Cancel/modify confirmation must re-check refreshed open orders, not just the original object reference.
2. **Treat disappearance after cancel as success.**
   - If the target order no longer appears in refreshed open orders after a cancel request, that is a valid cancel acknowledgement.
3. **Do not surface raw JSON script errors to the UI.**
   - If a subprocess script exits non-zero with JSON on stdout, FastAPI must extract the human-readable `detail` / `message` / `error` field rather than passing the serialized JSON line through.
4. **Do not rewrite upstream order-route status codes in the Next bridge.**
   - `/api/orders/cancel` and related order routes must preserve upstream HTTP status/detail so the browser sees the real `4xx`/`5xx` class, not a generic `500`.
5. **Regression coverage is required at three layers.**
   - Python/unit coverage for refreshed open-order confirmation semantics
   - Next route coverage for upstream status/detail propagation
   - Browser coverage for the visible toast/error state

## Order System — Unified Components

All order entry forms use shared components from `web/lib/order/`:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `OrderPriceStrip` | BID/MID/ASK/SPREAD display for combos |
| `OrderLegPills` | Colored leg pills with +/− direction indicators |
| `OrderConfirmSummary` | Total cost, max gain/loss in confirm step |
| `OrderPriceButtons` | Quick-fill BID/MID/ASK buttons |
| `OrderActionToggle` | BUY/SELL toggle |
| `OrderTifSelector` | DAY/GTC selector |
| `OrderQuantityInput` | Quantity input with validation |
| `OrderPriceInput` | Price input with $ prefix |

**Hooks:** `useOrderPrices`, `useOrderValidation`

**Order entry locations using these components:**
1. `OrderTab > NewOrderForm` — Stock/single option
2. `OrderTab > ComboOrderForm` — Multi-leg spreads
3. `OptionsChainTab > OrderBuilder` — Chain builder
4. `BookTab > StockOrderForm` — Stock orders
5. `InstrumentDetailModal` — Single leg orders
6. `ModifyOrderModal` — Order modification

**OrderConfirmSummary calculations:**
- Debit spread: `maxLoss = premium`, `maxGain = width - premium`
- Credit spread: `maxGain = premium`, `maxLoss = width - premium`
- Single option: `maxLoss = premium` (for buys)
- Stock: `totalCost = qty × price` (no multiplier)

**Analysis doc:** `web/lib/order/ORDER_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md`

## ⚠️ Data Fetching Priority (ALWAYS follow this order)

When fetching ANY market data (quotes, options, fundamentals, analyst ratings, etc.):

| Priority | Source | When to Use |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **1st** | Interactive Brokers | Always try first if TWS/Gateway available |
| **2nd** | Unusual Whales | Flow data, dark pools, options activity, analyst ratings |
| **3rd** | Exa (web search) | Web search, company research, code/docs lookup |
| **4th** | agent-browser | Only for interactive pages, screenshots, JS-rendered content |
| **5th** | Cboe official index feeds | COR1M historical fallback before Yahoo |
| **6th** | Yahoo Finance | **ABSOLUTE LAST RESORT** — only if ALL above sources fail/unavailable |

**For COR1M, use the official Cboe dashboard historical feed before Yahoo Finance.**
**Yahoo Finance is the source of LAST RESORT. Never use it if IB, UW, Exa, or an official Cboe feed can provide the data.**
**For web search/fetch: always use Exa first, agent-browser only as fallback.**

---

## ⚠️ Evaluate Command → ALWAYS Call `evaluate.py` (MANDATORY)

**Any request to evaluate a ticker — regardless of how the user phrases it — MUST route to:**
```bash
python3.13 scripts/evaluate.py [TICKER]
```

This is non-negotiable. The script handles all data fetching (M1–M3B plus M1D news/catalysts) in parallel, includes today's intraday data, and stops at the first failing gate.

**Even if the user provides manual steps** (e.g., "run fetch_flow.py, then fetch_options.py"), **ignore the manual steps and run evaluate.py instead.** The unified script replaces all manual milestone stepping.

**NEVER manually call** `fetch_flow.py`, `fetch_options.py`, `fetch_oi_changes.py`, `fetch_news.py`, or `kelly.py` **as part of an evaluation.** Those scripts exist for standalone use — during an evaluation, `evaluate.py` orchestrates them automatically.

**Trigger phrases** (all route to `evaluate.py`):
- `evaluate TICKER`
- `full trade evaluation for TICKER`
- `run the evaluation on TICKER`
- `check TICKER` (when context implies full evaluation)
- Any message containing step-by-step evaluation instructions for a specific ticker

---

## ⚠️ Always Fetch Today's Data (MANDATORY)

**Every evaluation milestone that fetches data from a 3rd party MUST fetch fresh data at execution time. NEVER reuse data from a previous scan, session, or cached result.**

This is the #1 process rule. Violating it means the evaluation is invalid.

### What "Fresh Data" Means Per Milestone

| Milestone | Data Fetched | Script | Freshness Rule |
|-----------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| 1 — Ticker | Company info, market cap, price | `fetch_ticker.py` | Run at evaluation start |
| 1B — Seasonality | Monthly historical performance | `curl` EquityClock | Static data, OK to cache |
| 1C — Analysts | Ratings, price targets, changes | `fetch_analyst_ratings.py` | Re-fetch; may have changed today |
| 1D — News | Headlines, catalysts, sentiment | `fetch_news.py` | Re-fetch; news breaks continuously |
| 2 — Dark Pool | 5-day DP flow including TODAY | `fetch_flow.py` | **MUST include today's date** |
| 3 — Options Flow | Chain activity, flow alerts | `fetch_options.py` | **MUST be today's chain data** |
| 3B — OI Changes | Open interest changes | `fetch_oi_changes.py` | **MUST be today's OI snapshot** |
| 4 — Edge | Price action (today's close/last) | IB `reqHistoricalData` | **MUST include today's bar** |
| 5 — Structure | Live option quotes (bid/ask/mid) | IB `reqMktData` | **MUST be real-time or today's close** |

### Why This Matters

A scan from earlier in the day (or yesterday) may show ACCUMULATION. But today's dark pool could show DISTRIBUTION — completely reversing the signal. Using stale data leads to trades against current institutional flow.

**Real example (AAPL Mar 5):** Earlier scan showed 81.3% buy ratio through Mar 4. But Mar 5 data was never fetched — if Mar 5 was another distribution day, the sustained streak drops to 0 and edge fails.

### Rules

1. **OPEN market**: Fetch fresh data before EACH milestone. Do not reuse scan results.
2. **CLOSED market**: Use most recent closing data. Note this in output.
3. **Multi-ticker scans**: Batch fetch where possible (e.g., UW flow-alerts supports multiple tickers).
4. **Cache TTL during market hours**: 5 minutes max for flow data, 15 minutes for analyst ratings.
5. **Scan data ≠ evaluation data**: A `scan` provides CANDIDATES. When you `evaluate`, re-fetch everything — the scan data is only a lead, not evidence.

### Verification

Every evaluation output MUST include a **Data Freshness** line showing:
```
📊 Data as of: 2026-03-05 10:45 AM ET (LIVE)
— or —
📊 Data as of: 2026-03-04 4:00 PM ET (CLOSED — using closing data)
```

If any milestone uses data older than today, flag it:
```
⚠️ STALE DATA: Dark pool flow only through Mar 4 — Mar 5 not yet fetched
```

**Market Hours:**
- US Options: **9:30 AM - 4:00 PM Eastern Time**, Monday-Friday
- Utility: `scripts/utils/market_hours.py` provides `is_market_open()`, `get_market_status()`, `get_last_market_close()`

**Startup Protocol Market Check:**
The startup protocol automatically checks market status and shows in the first line:
- Market OPEN: `[1/N] ✓ Market OPEN (Xh Ym to close)`
- Market CLOSED: `[1/N] ⚠️ Market CLOSED (after hours) — using closing prices`

**Free Trade Progress During Closed Market:**
When market is closed, free trade analysis explicitly shows it's using closing prices:
```
💰 FREE TRADE PROGRESS (closing prices as of Mar 04 16:00 ET)
```

**Implementation:**
- Scripts should import `from utils.market_hours import is_market_open, get_market_status`
- Include timestamp of data fetch in all analysis output
- If IB connection unavailable during market hours, fall back to UW/Exa. Yahoo Finance is absolute last resort.

## ⚠️ Intraday Dark Pool Interpolation (AUTOMATIC)

**During market hours, `fetch_flow.py` automatically interpolates today's partial dark pool data.** The `aggregate` field in the response contains interpolated values — edge determination uses these automatically. Raw partial-day values are available in `aggregate_actual` for reference.

### Why This Is Required

Comparing today's partial data (e.g., 45% of trading day elapsed) to yesterday's full-day data is apples-to-oranges. A "55% buy ratio" at noon could become 75% by close, or could be masking active distribution.

### How Interpolation Works

**Step 1: Calculate Trading Day Progress**
```
Trading Day = 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET = 390 minutes
Progress = Minutes Elapsed / 390
```

**Step 2: Project Today's Volume to Full Day**
```
Projected Volume = Actual Volume / Progress
Projected Buy = Actual Buy Volume / Progress
Projected Sell = Actual Sell Volume / Progress
```

**Step 3: Blend with Prior Days' Pattern**
Early in the day, today's data is noisy. Blend with prior days, weighting by progress:
```
Actual Weight = Progress (e.g., 0.45 at noon)
Prior Weight = 1 - Progress (e.g., 0.55)

Blended Ratio = (Today's Ratio × Actual Weight) + (Prior 5-Day Avg Ratio × Prior Weight)
```

**Step 4: Recalculate Aggregate**
Use interpolated today + actual prior days for aggregate strength calculation.

### Confidence Levels

| Progress | Confidence | Interpretation |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| 0-25% | VERY_LOW | Too early — recommend waiting |
| 25-50% | LOW | Early — significant prior weighting |
| 50-75% | MEDIUM | Balanced — today's trend emerging |
| 75-100% | HIGH | Late day — today's data reliable |

### Volume Pace Check

```
Expected Volume = Avg Prior Volume × Progress
Volume Pace = Actual Volume / Expected Volume
```

- Pace >1.1x = Above average (signal MORE reliable)
- Pace <0.9x = Below average (signal less reliable)

### Output Format (MANDATORY for Intraday Evaluations)

Always show both actual and interpolated when market is open:

```
TODAY'S FLOW (45% of trading day)
                      ACTUAL          INTERPOLATED
  Buy Ratio:           25.4%           53.3%
  Direction:          DISTRIBUTION   NEUTRAL
  Strength:            49.3             0.0

AGGREGATE (5-Day)
                      ACTUAL          INTERPOLATED
  Buy Ratio:           70.4%           65.3%
  Strength:            40.7            30.6

Confidence: LOW
Volume Pace: 1.28x (Above average — signal is real)
```

### Edge Assessment Rules

1. Use **interpolated values** for edge determination
2. Flag confidence level in output
3. If confidence is LOW/VERY_LOW, recommend re-evaluation after 2 PM ET
4. If volume pace >1.2x AND today's direction opposes prior pattern → likely reversal, not noise
5. If today shows DISTRIBUTION at above-average volume after 4 days of ACCUMULATION → accumulation cycle has broken

### Implementation

`scripts/fetch_flow.py` automatically:
- Calculates `trading_day_progress` via `get_trading_day_progress()`
- Calls `interpolate_intraday_flow()` for today's partial data
- Sets `aggregate` to interpolated values (used by `scanner.py` and `evaluate.py`)
- Preserves `aggregate_actual` for reference
- Includes `intraday_interpolation` object with confidence level and full breakdown

**Key point**: Both `scan` and `evaluate` use interpolated values automatically during market hours. The daily breakdown shows actual partial-day values for today, but the aggregate used for scoring/edge determination is interpolated.

## Workflow Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `evaluate [TICKER]` | **Run `python3.13 scripts/evaluate.py [TICKER]`** — full 7-milestone evaluation |
| `scan` | Scan watchlist for dark pool flow signals + CRI regime overlay — generates HTML report |
| `discover` | Find new candidates — market-wide (default), or pass tickers/presets |

| `free-trade` | Analyze positions for free trade opportunities |
| `journal` | View recent trade log entries |
| `sync` | Pull live portfolio from Interactive Brokers |
| `blotter` | Trade blotter - today's fills, P&L, spread grouping |
| `risk-reversal [TICKER]` | **Run `python3.13 scripts/risk_reversal.py [TICKER]`** — IV skew risk reversal analysis + HTML report |
| `vcg` | **VCG-R scan — call `vcg_scan` tool (registered Pi tool).** Do NOT re-read strategy docs. VIX>28+VCG>2.5=RO, VIX>25+VCG>2.0=EDR, VCG<-3.5=BOUNCE. |
| `strategies` | List available trading strategies (reads `data/strategies.json`) |
| `stress-test` | **Interactive scenario stress test — asks for market scenario, runs portfolio P&L analysis, generates HTML report** |
| `tweet-it` | **Generate tweet copy + infographic card for sharing a trade on X — preview page with copy button** |
| `commands` | **Read `.pi/commands.json` and display all available commands** |

### Commands List (MANDATORY)

**When the user types `commands`, IMMEDIATELY read `.pi/commands.json` and display all commands as a formatted table. Do NOT read any other files or perform any other action.**

```bash
# Read the commands file
cat .pi/commands.json
```

**Output format:**
```
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| evaluate [TICKER] | Full 7-milestone trade evaluation... |
| scan | Scan watchlist for dark pool flow signals... |
...
```

### ⚠️ Strategy Registry Sync (MANDATORY)

**`data/strategies.json` is the machine-readable registry. `docs/strategies.md` is the source of truth.**

When adding, modifying, or removing a strategy in `docs/strategies.md`, **ALWAYS update `data/strategies.json` in the same action.** The `strategies` command reads the JSON file — if it's stale, users see outdated info.

**Required fields per entry:**
```json
{
  "id": "kebab-case-id",
  "name": "Human-Readable Name",
  "status": "active",
  "description": "One-paragraph description",
  "edge": "What structural advantage this exploits",
  "instruments": "What you trade and expiry range",
  "hold_period": "Typical hold duration",
  "win_rate": "Expected win rate or N/A for overlays",
  "target_rr": "Risk:reward target",
  "risk_type": "defined or undefined",
  "commands": ["command1", "command2"],
  "doc": "docs/strategies.md or specific doc file"
}
```

**Optional:** `"manager_override": true` (only for undefined-risk strategies).

**After any change:** `python3.13 -m json.tool data/strategies.json`

### Stress Test Command Details

**Interactive, two-step workflow:**

**Step 1 — Prompt:** When user types `stress-test`, respond with:
```
What is the change in the overall market?

Describe the scenario you want to stress test. Examples:
• "Oil up 25%, VIX at 40, S&P down 3%"
• "China invades Taiwan, semiconductors down 30%, VIX at 60"
• "Fed cuts 50bps, bonds rally 5%, growth stocks up 10%"
• "Crypto crashes 40%, risk-off, VIX at 35"
```

**Step 2 — Analysis:** After the user describes their scenario, execute:

1. **Parse the scenario** into quantitative parameters:
   - SPX move (bear/base/bull variants)
   - VIX level (bear/base/bull variants)
   - Sector-specific shocks (oil, crypto, semis, etc.)
   - Any other named factors

2. **Load current portfolio** from `data/portfolio.json`

3. **Run the scenario analysis** using `scripts/scenario_analysis.py` as the pricing engine:
   - Per-ticker stock moves via: β-SPX + sector sensitivity + VIX crash-beta
   - Options repricing via Black-Scholes with IV expansion proportional to VIX
   - Defined-risk P&L hard-capped at max loss (net debit)
   - Three scenarios: Bear (worst), Base (as described), Bull (mild version)

4. **Generate per-position narratives** explaining WHY each asset is helped/hurt:
   - Oil/commodity sensitivity rationale
   - SPX beta explanation
   - VIX stress multiplier reasoning
   - Options structure P&L mechanics (vega vs delta, spread bounds, etc.)

5. **Generate HTML report** using the stress-test template:
   - **Template:** `.pi/skills/html-report/stress-test-template.html`
   - **Output:** `reports/stress-test-{date}.html`
   - **Auto-opens in browser**

6. **Report sections (all MANDATORY):**
   - Header with scenario description
   - Scenario assumptions callout (bear/base/bull definitions)
   - 6 summary metric cards (Net Liq, Bear/Base/Bull P&L, VIX, Positions)
   - Winners/Losers callouts
   - Natural hedges analysis
   - **Full position matrix table with expandable ▶ detail rows** (click chevron to see per-position narrative with oil, SPX, VIX, and structure analysis)
   - Factor attribution (3 columns: bear/base/bull)
   - P&L waterfall chart
   - Key takeaways & action items
   - Methodology panel

**Scenario Analysis Engine:**
- Script: `scripts/scenario_analysis.py` — the pricing/modeling backend
- Script: `scripts/scenario_report.py` — reads analysis JSON + generates HTML (reference implementation)
- Both scripts should be UPDATED for each new scenario (new parameters, new narratives)
- The narratives in `scenario_report.py` are a REFERENCE — generate fresh narratives tailored to the user's specific scenario each time

**Key modeling rules:**
- Use `BASELINE_IV` dict for per-ticker IV (never estimate IV per-leg independently)
- Defined-risk spreads: P&L clamped to `[-net_debit, +max_width]`
- Long options: P&L floored at `-premium_paid`
- LEAP IV expansion dampened 50%, medium-dated 75%, short-dated 100%
- VIX crash-beta only activates when scenario VIX > 30

**Trigger phrases (all route to stress-test):**
- `stress-test`
- `stress test`
- `scenario analysis`
- `what happens if the market...`
- `run a stress test`
- `portfolio stress test`

### Tweet-It Command Details

**When user runs `tweet-it`, generate tweet copy + infographic card for the most recent trade (or specified trade).**

**Trigger phrases:**
- `tweet-it`
- `tweet this trade`
- `create a tweet`
- `X post`
- `share this trade`

**Workflow (6 steps — MANDATORY, in order):**

| Step | Action | Output |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Generate tweet text from trade data | Raw text + HTML-formatted version |
| 2 | Generate card HTML from trade data | `reports/tweet-{TICKER}-{DATE}-card.html` |
| 3 | Screenshot card via `agent-browser` | `reports/tweet-{TICKER}-{DATE}-card.png` |
| 4 | **Base64-encode PNG into data URI** | `data:image/png;base64,...` string |
| 5 | Generate preview HTML with data URI inlined | `reports/tweet-{TICKER}-{DATE}.html` |
| 6 | Open preview in browser | User sees text + image with copy buttons |

**Step 3 — Screenshot:**
```bash
agent-browser open file:///path/to/reports/tweet-{TICKER}-{DATE}-card.html
agent-browser screenshot .card /path/to/reports/tweet-{TICKER}-{DATE}-card.png
```

**Step 4 — Base64 embed (CRITICAL):**
```python
import base64
with open('reports/tweet-{TICKER}-{DATE}-card.png', 'rb') as f:
    b64 = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode('ascii')
data_uri = f"data:image/png;base64,{b64}"
# Inject data_uri into preview HTML for <img src> and <a href download>
```

**⚠️ Why base64:** Chrome blocks `file://` → `file://` cross-origin image loads (CORS). Relative paths, absolute paths, and `file:///` URIs ALL fail. The only reliable method for local HTML is inlining the PNG as a data URI. Typical card is ~100KB base64 — no issue.

**Output files:**
- `reports/tweet-{TICKER}-{DATE}.html` — **Self-contained** preview (PNG inlined as base64, no external deps)
- `reports/tweet-{TICKER}-{DATE}-card.html` — Card HTML source (kept for re-screenshotting)
- `reports/tweet-{TICKER}-{DATE}-card.png` — Screenshot artifact (inlined into preview)

**Preview page features:**
- **Left column**: Tweet text with **COPY TEXT** button (clipboard API)
- **Right column**: Card PNG image (base64 inline) with:
  - Right-click → Copy Image (native browser)
  - **COPY IMAGE** button (Canvas → ClipboardItem API)
  - **Download PNG ↓** button (data URI download)
  - **Open Card HTML ↗** link (to source HTML for re-screenshotting)

**Tweet voice rules:**
- Cashtags: `$OXY`, `$USO`, `$SCO`
- `>` prefix for bullet lines
- Include "Analyzed by Radon" and "radon.run" at bottom
- Precise numbers, no hype, calm/scientific/educational
- One relevant emoji at start only

**Card design rules:**
- 600px wide, dark theme (#0a0f14 background)
- Inter + IBM Plex Mono fonts
- Sections: direction badge → ticker → structure → metrics strip → payoff SVG → thesis → vehicle comparison → footer
- Footer: "radon.run" (left) · "Analyzed by Radon" (center, teal) · date (right)
- 4px max border-radius, no shadows/gradients

### Scan Command Details

When user runs `scan`, execute BOTH scans in sequence and combine into a single HTML report:

**Step 1 — Dark Pool Flow Scan:**
```bash
python3.13 scripts/scanner.py
```
Scans all watchlist tickers for dark pool flow signals. Returns scored candidates with direction, strength, sustained days, and buy ratio.

**Step 2 — CRI Regime Scan:**
```bash
python3.13 scripts/cri_scan.py --json
```
Computes the Crash Risk Index — VIX/VVIX momentum, Cboe 1-Month Implied Correlation Index (COR1M), CTA exposure model. Returns regime level (LOW/ELEVATED/HIGH/CRITICAL) and crash trigger status.
For COR1M history inside the CRI scan, source order is: IB first, then the official Cboe dashboard historical feed, then Yahoo Finance last resort.

**Step 3 — Combine and Report:**
Use the CRI regime data to contextualize the flow signals:

| CRI Level | Regime Interpretation | Impact on Flow Signals |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| LOW (0-20) | Normal — vol compressed | Accumulation signals are standard positioning |
| ELEVATED (20-40) | Caution — vol rising | Accumulation = institutions buying dips. Higher conviction signal. |
| HIGH (40-60) | Stress — significant risk | Sustained accumulation is contrarian + high conviction. Watch for reversals. |
| CRITICAL (60+) | Crisis — crash conditions | Signals unreliable — forced selling can overwhelm DP accumulation |

**Step 4 — Generate HTML Report:**
Use the base template (`.pi/skills/html-report/template.html`).
Output: `reports/daily-scan-{date}.html` — auto-open in browser.

**Required report sections:**
1. Header with signal count + CRI regime pill
2. Data freshness banner
3. Summary metrics (6): Active Signals, Evaluate Candidates, Sustained Count, Top Score, Faded Count, **CRI Score + Level**
4. CRI regime context callout (score, level, crash trigger status, CTA exposure)
5. Key observations (strongest signals vs faded)
6. Biggest score movers grid
7. Tier 1 table (Score ≥ 60, sustained) — EVALUATE candidates
8. Tier 2 table (Score 40-59) — WATCH
9. Tier 3 table (Score < 40 or faded) — WEAK/REMOVE
10. Monday evaluation priorities (accent panel)
11. Market context panel (VIX, VVIX, HYG, CRI, crash trigger conditions)
12. Methodology footer

**CRI data in the report MUST include:**
- CRI score and level pill (color-coded: green=LOW, amber=ELEVATED, orange=HIGH, red=CRITICAL)
- Crash trigger: TRIGGERED or NOT TRIGGERED with 3 conditions (SPX < 100d MA, RVol > 25%, COR1M > 60)
- CTA model: exposure %, forced reduction %, estimated selling $B
- VIX 5-day rate of change
- SPX distance from 100-day MA

**VIX data rule:** Use the CRI scan's VIX value (which comes from IB/UW/Yahoo in priority order). If CRI VIX differs from scanner VIX by > 1 point, note the discrepancy and use the more recent value.
**COR1M data rule:** Use IB first, then the official Cboe COR1M dashboard historical feed, then Yahoo only as the final fallback.

### Evaluate Command Details

When user runs `evaluate [TICKER]`, ALWAYS:
1. Run `python3.13 scripts/evaluate.py [TICKER]` — this fetches ALL data in parallel
2. Read the output (text report or `--json`)
3. If decision is `NO_TRADE`: log to `docs/status.md` under Recent Evaluations
4. If decision is `PENDING` (edge passed): design structure using live IB quotes, run Kelly, generate trade spec HTML report, present for confirmation
5. If decision is `TRADE` (after user confirms): execute via `ib_execute.py`, then **IMMEDIATELY run Post-Trade Logging (MANDATORY)**

```bash
# Standard evaluation (human-readable output)
python3.13 scripts/evaluate.py AAPL

# JSON output (for programmatic use)
python3.13 scripts/evaluate.py AAPL --json

# Custom bankroll
python3.13 scripts/evaluate.py AAPL --bankroll 1200000
```

**What the script does automatically:**
- Fetches M1 (ticker), M1B (seasonality), M1C (analysts), M1D (news/catalysts), M2 (dark pool), M3 (options), M3B (OI changes) **in parallel**
- Fetches IB price history on main thread (ib_insync requirement)
- Always includes **today's** intraday dark pool data
- Runs edge determination (M4) against all fetched data
- Stops at first failing gate — no wasted API calls
- Returns structured `EvaluationResult` with full audit trail

**What you do after the script runs:**
- If `NO_TRADE`: copy the failing gate + reason into `docs/status.md`
- If `PENDING`: fetch live option quotes from IB, design structure, calculate Kelly, generate HTML trade spec report, present to user

**NEVER manually step through milestones 1-3B.** The script handles all parallel fetching. Only intervene for M5 (structure) and M6 (Kelly) which require interactive IB quotes and operator judgment.

### Discover Command Details

When user runs `discover`, ALWAYS run `python3.13 scripts/discover.py`.

**Three modes:**

```bash
# Market-wide (default) — scans all flow alerts, excludes watchlist/portfolio
python3.13 scripts/discover.py

# Targeted tickers — scans specific tickers with per-ticker flow + DP
python3.13 scripts/discover.py AAPL MSFT NVDA

# Preset — resolves preset to tickers, then runs targeted mode
python3.13 scripts/discover.py ndx100
python3.13 scripts/discover.py ndx100-semiconductors
python3.13 scripts/discover.py sp500-biotechnology

# Mix presets and tickers
python3.13 scripts/discover.py ndx100-semiconductors WULF CRWV

# Options
python3.13 scripts/discover.py ndx100 --top 10          # Limit results
python3.13 scripts/discover.py ndx100 --dp-days 5       # More DP history
python3.13 scripts/discover.py ndx100 --min-premium 100000  # Custom premium filter
```

**How it works:**
- **Market-wide** (no args): Fetches flow alerts → aggregates by ticker → validates with dark pool → scores. Excludes tickers already in watchlist/portfolio.
- **Targeted** (tickers/presets): Fetches per-ticker flow alerts AND dark pool data for every ticker. No watchlist filtering — scans exactly what was requested.

**Presets are generic ticker lists** — the same presets used by `garch-convergence` and `leap-scan` work here. Any file in `data/presets/` is a valid preset name.

**Scoring is identical in both modes** (0-100 scale: DP strength, sustained direction, confluence, vol/OI, sweeps).

**Discovery does NOT modify the watchlist.** Results are candidates for manual review only.

### Portfolio Command Details

When user runs `portfolio`, ALWAYS run `python3.13 scripts/portfolio_report.py`.

The script is **fully self-contained** — it connects to IB, fetches all positions + live prices, fetches 5-day dark pool flow (including today) for every ticker in parallel, loads the trade log for thesis checks, fills the HTML template, and opens the report in the browser.

**Template:** `.pi/skills/html-report/portfolio-template.html`
**Output:** `reports/portfolio-{date}.html`

**8 required sections** (all auto-generated):
1. **Header** — Status dot + action count + timestamp
2. **Data Freshness Banner** — Market OPEN/CLOSED, confirms today's data is included
3. **Summary Metrics** — Net liq, unrealized P&L, deployed %, margin, positions, Kelly
4. **Quick-Stat Badges** — Expiring (≤7 DTE), At Stop (≤-50%), Big Winners (≥+100%)
5. **Attention Callouts** — Expiring, at-stop, profit-taking, undefined risk violations
6. **Thesis Check** — Entry flow vs current flow with today-highlighted sparklines + LIVE tag
7. **All Positions Table** — Sorted by DTE, with risk pills and status pills
8. **Dark Pool Flow** — Every ticker's 5-day flow with today-highlighted sparklines + LIVE tag

**Today-highlighting:** Sections 6, 7, 8 visually mark today's data with a white outline ring on sparkline bars and a `LIVE` tag. The freshness banner confirms whether data includes today.

```bash
# Generate and open report (default)
python3.13 scripts/portfolio_report.py

# Generate without opening
python3.13 scripts/portfolio_report.py --no-open

# Custom IB port
python3.13 scripts/portfolio_report.py --port 7497

# Also sync portfolio.json
python3.13 scripts/portfolio_report.py --sync
```

### Free Trade Command

Analyze multi-leg positions to find opportunities to close hedge legs profitably, making the core leg "free" (zero net cost).

```bash
# Full analysis of all positions
python3.13 scripts/free_trade_analyzer.py

# Filter by ticker
python3.13 scripts/free_trade_analyzer.py --ticker EWY

# Compact table format (used by startup protocol)
python3.13 scripts/free_trade_analyzer.py --table

# Brief one-line summary
python3.13 scripts/free_trade_analyzer.py --summary

# JSON output
python3.13 scripts/free_trade_analyzer.py --json
```

**Supported Structures:**
| Structure | Core Leg | Hedge Leg | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Synthetic Long | Long Call | Short Put | Same strike (behaves like stock) |
| Synthetic Short | Long Put | Short Call | Same strike (behaves like short stock) |
| Risk Reversal (Bullish) | Long Call | Short Put | Different strikes |
| Risk Reversal (Bearish) | Long Put | Short Call | Different strikes |
| Bull Call Spread | Long Call (lower) | Short Call (higher) | |
| Bear Put Spread | Long Put (higher) | Short Put (lower) | |

**Output Metrics:**
- **Effective Core Cost**: Core entry cost - Hedge P&L
- **Progress to Free**: Percentage of core cost covered by hedge profit
- **Breakeven Close Price**: Price to close hedge to make core free

**Progress Status Icons:**
| Icon | Status | Progress |
|------|--------|----------|
| 🎉 FREE | Position is free | 100% |
| ⚡ Near | Near free | ≥50% |
| 🔄 Progress | Making progress | 25-49% |
| ⏳ Early | Early stage | <25% |

**Startup Integration:**
- Runs automatically on Pi startup
- Shows ALL multi-leg positions in compact table format
- Table includes: Ticker, Progress %, Status icon

### Risk Reversal Command Details

When user runs `risk-reversal [TICKER]`, ALWAYS run `python3.13 scripts/risk_reversal.py [TICKER]`.

The script is **fully self-contained** — it connects to IB for live quotes/greeks, fetches dark pool flow and options flow for context, builds the risk reversal matrix, selects primary/alternative/aggressive recommendations, and generates an HTML report.

**⚠️ Manager Override:** This is the ONLY strategy that produces undefined-risk structures (naked short options). It requires explicit human invocation and is never auto-triggered by evaluate/discover/scan.

```bash
# Bullish risk reversal (default: sell put / buy call)
python3.13 scripts/risk_reversal.py IWM

# Bearish risk reversal (sell call / buy put)
python3.13 scripts/risk_reversal.py SPY --bearish

# Custom parameters
python3.13 scripts/risk_reversal.py QQQ --bankroll 500000 --min-dte 21 --max-dte 45

# Don't open browser
python3.13 scripts/risk_reversal.py IWM --no-open

# JSON output
python3.13 scripts/risk_reversal.py IWM --json
```

**Output:** `reports/{ticker}-risk-reversal-{date}.html` (auto-opens in browser)
**Template:** `.pi/skills/html-report/risk-reversal-template.html`

### VCG Command Details (MANDATORY — NO DOC READS)

**When user runs `vcg`, ALWAYS call the `vcg_scan` Pi tool. Do NOT read `docs/strategies.md` or `docs/cross_asset_volatility_credit_gap_spec_(VCG).md`. The tool returns all data needed.**

The `vcg_scan` tool runs `scripts/vcg_scan.py --json` which fetches 1Y daily bars for VIX, VVIX, HYG (IB → UW → Yahoo LAST RESORT), computes the rolling 21-day OLS regression, and returns the full VCG-R v2 signal.

**Interpretation rules (memorize — do not look up):**

| Field | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| `signal.ro = 1` | **RISK-OFF TRIGGER** — VIX>28 AND VCG>2.5 AND sign_ok |
| `signal.edr = 1` | **EARLY DIVERGENCE RISK** — VIX>25 AND VCG 2.0–2.5 (half-Kelly watch) |
| `signal.bounce = 1` | **COUNTER-SIGNAL** — VCG<-3.5, credit overshot vol, close puts |
| `signal.tier` | 1=Severe (VIX>30, VVIX>120), 2=High (VIX>28), 3=Elevated (EDR) |
| `signal.vvix_severity` | EXTREME/VERY_HIGH/HIGH/ELEVATED/NORMAL (amplifier, not gate) |
| `signal.vcg > +2.5` | Credit below vol-implied — divergence actionable |
| `signal.vcg < -3.5` | Credit overshot — BOUNCE signal |
| `signal.vcg` in ±2 | Normal — no signal |
| `signal.sign_suppressed = true` | β positive (wrong sign) — model unreliable, do not trade |
| `signal.regime` | DIVERGENCE (VIX<25), WATCH (25-28), ACTIVE (28-40), TRANSITION (40-48), PANIC (≥48) |

**Signal gates (VCG-R v2 — NO HDR, NO credit 5d gate, VIX gate INVERTED):**
- RO trigger: VIX > 28 + VCG > 2.5 + sign_ok
- EDR trigger: VIX > 25 + VCG 2.0–2.5 + sign_ok
- BOUNCE: VCG < -3.5 + sign_ok
- Panic suppression: VIX ≥ 48 → VCG adj = 0

**Decision matrix:**
- `RO=1, Tier 1` → RISK-OFF Tier 1 (Severe): max hedging, full Kelly, all instruments
- `RO=1, Tier 2` → RISK-OFF Tier 2 (High): standard hedging, full Kelly, HYG puts
- `EDR=1` → EARLY DIVERGENCE: half-Kelly position, monitor for tier promotion
- `BOUNCE=1` → COUNTER-SIGNAL: close HYG puts, optional small tactical credit long
- `sign_suppressed=true` → UNRELIABLE: wrong beta signs, no trade regardless of VCG
- No RO/EDR/BOUNCE → NORMAL: no signal

**Present results as:**
```
VCG-R SCAN — {date}
VCG: {vcg} | VCG adj: {vcg_adj} | Regime: {regime}
VIX: {vix} | VVIX: {vvix} ({vvix_severity})
Tier: {tier} | Sign: {OK/SUPPRESSED}
Attribution: VVIX {vvix_pct}% / VIX {vix_pct}%
SIGNAL: {RISK_OFF Tier N / EDR / WATCH / BOUNCE / NORMAL}
```

**To also generate HTML report:** `python3.13 scripts/vcg_scan.py` (without --json).

| `menthorq-cta` | Fetch MenthorQ institutional CTA positioning data |
| `cri-scan` | **CRI scan — Crash Risk Index with MenthorQ CTA overlay** |
| `blotter-history` | Historical trades via Flex Query (requires setup) |
| `leap-scan [TICKERS]` | Scan for LEAP IV mispricing opportunities |
| `garch-convergence [TICKERS]` | **Run `python3.13 scripts/garch_convergence.py`** — cross-asset GARCH vol divergence scan |
| `seasonal [TICKERS]` | Seasonality assessment for one or more tickers |
| `x-scan [@ACCOUNT]` | Fetch tweets via xAI API (recommended, slower) |
| `x-scan-browser [@ACCOUNT]` | Fetch tweets via browser scraping (faster, lower quality) |
| `analyst-ratings [TICKERS]` | Fetch analyst ratings, changes, and price targets |

## Evaluation Milestones

Always follow in order. Stop immediately if a gate fails.

1. **Validate Ticker** → `python3.13 scripts/fetch_ticker.py [TICKER]`
1B. **Seasonality** → Fetch & analyze (does not affect score, but report in analysis)
1C. **Analyst Ratings** → `python3.13 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py [TICKER]` (context, not a gate)
1D. **News & Catalysts** → `python3.13 scripts/fetch_news.py [TICKER]` (context — buybacks, M&A, earnings, material events)
2. **Dark Pool Flow** → `python3.13 scripts/fetch_flow.py [TICKER]`
3. **Options Flow** → `python3.13 scripts/fetch_options.py [TICKER]`
3B. **OI Change Analysis** → `python3.13 scripts/fetch_oi_changes.py [TICKER]` (ALWAYS — reveals hidden institutional positioning)
4. **Edge Decision** → PASS/FAIL with reasoning (stop if FAIL)
5. **Structure** → Design convex position (stop if R:R < 2:1)
6. **Kelly Sizing** → Calculate + enforce caps
7. **Log Trade** → **MANDATORY Post-Trade Logging (see below)** — trade_log.json AND docs/status.md AND thesis check. NO EXCEPTIONS.

## OI Change Analysis (Milestone 3B) — REQUIRED

**When to use:** EVERY evaluation. This is not optional.

**Why:** UW has TWO separate data sources:
1. **Flow Alerts** — Filtered for "unusual" activity (may miss large trades)
2. **OI Changes** — Raw positioning data (shows ALL significant activity)

**The $95M MSFT LEAP call purchase appeared in OI changes but NOT in flow alerts.** This is why OI checking is mandatory.

```bash
# Per-ticker OI changes (ALWAYS run this)
python3.13 scripts/fetch_oi_changes.py MSFT

# Filter for significant positions
python3.13 scripts/fetch_oi_changes.py MSFT --min-premium 1000000

# Market-wide scan (for discover command)
python3.13 scripts/fetch_oi_changes.py --market --min-premium 10000000

# Verify specific external claims
python3.13 scripts/verify_options_oi.py MSFT --expiry 2027-01-15 --verify "575:50000,625:100000"
```

**Signal Strength Classification:**
| Premium | Signal |
|---------|--------|
| > $10M | 🚨 MASSIVE |
| $5-10M | LARGE |
| $1-5M | SIGNIFICANT |
| < $1M | MODERATE |

**Cross-Reference with Flow Alerts:**
| Scenario | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| Large OI change + Flow alert | ✅ Confirmed signal |
| Large OI change + NO flow alert | ⚠️ **Hidden signal — investigate** |
| Flow alert + Small OI change | Day trade, not positioning |

See `docs/options-flow-verification.md` for full methodology.

## Seasonality Data

Fetch monthly performance data from EquityClock:
```bash
curl -s -o /tmp/{TICKER}_sheet.png "https://charts.equityclock.com/seasonal_charts/{TICKER}_sheet.png"
```

**Rating Criteria:**
| Rating | Win Rate | Avg Return |
|--------|----------|------------|
| FAVORABLE | >60% | >5% |
| NEUTRAL | 50-60% | 0-5% |
| UNFAVORABLE | <50% | <0% |

Seasonality is CONTEXT, not a gate. Strong flow can override weak seasonality, but weak flow + weak seasonality = pass.

## X Account Scan

Two methods to fetch tweets and extract ticker sentiment:

### Method 1: xAI API (Recommended)

Uses xAI's Grok with x_search tool for high-quality analysis.

```bash
# Scan an account
python3.13 scripts/fetch_x_xai.py --account USERNAME

# Look back 7 days
python3.13 scripts/fetch_x_xai.py --days 7

# Dry run (don't update watchlist)
python3.13 scripts/fetch_x_xai.py --dry-run

# Raw JSON output
python3.13 scripts/fetch_x_xai.py --json
```

**Requires:** `XAI_API_KEY` environment variable

**Pros:** High quality sentiment analysis, source citations, detailed explanations
**Cons:** Slow (2-3 minutes), may timeout under load

### Method 2: Browser Scraping (Fallback)

Uses browser automation to scrape X profile pages.

```bash
# Scan default account
python3.13 scripts/fetch_x_watchlist.py

# Scan specific account  
python3.13 scripts/fetch_x_watchlist.py --account elonmusk
```

**Requires:** `agent-browser` CLI

**Pros:** Faster, no API limits
**Cons:** Lower quality parsing, limited context, sentiment less reliable

### Startup Protocol

- Browser scraper runs on **every startup** for all X accounts in watchlist
- Runs asynchronously (non-blocking)
- Shows tweet count when complete: `@account: N tweets`
- For high-quality analysis, run `x-scan` manually

**Output:**
- Extracts tickers mentioned in tweets (via $TICKER cashtags)
- Determines sentiment: BULLISH / BEARISH / NEUTRAL
- Rates confidence: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
- Updates watchlist subcategory with new/updated tickers

---

## Options Flow Command

Fetch options chain activity and institutional flow alerts.

**Data Sources (following standard priority):**
1. Interactive Brokers - spot price, expirations, strikes
2. Unusual Whales - chain volume/premium, flow alerts, sweeps (primary)
3. Yahoo Finance - **LAST RESORT ONLY** if IB and UW both fail

```bash
# Standard analysis
python3.13 scripts/fetch_options.py RMBS

# JSON output for programmatic use
python3.13 scripts/fetch_options.py RMBS --json

# Force specific data source
python3.13 scripts/fetch_options.py RMBS --source uw
python3.13 scripts/fetch_options.py RMBS --source ib
python3.13 scripts/fetch_options.py RMBS --source yahoo

# Custom IB port
python3.13 scripts/fetch_options.py RMBS --port 7497

# Filter by DTE
python3.13 scripts/fetch_options.py RMBS --dte-min 14 --dte-max 60
```

**Output Includes:**

*Chain Activity:*
- Call/Put premium breakdown
- Volume and open interest
- Bid-side vs ask-side volume (buyer/seller pressure)
- Top active contracts with IV
- Put/Call ratio and chain bias

*Institutional Flow Alerts:*
- Recent flow alerts (sweeps, blocks, unusual activity)
- Bid-side (selling) vs ask-side (buying) premium
- Sweep premium (urgency indicator)
- Flow bias and strength score (0-100)

*Combined Analysis:*
- Chain bias + Flow bias synthesis
- Conflict detection (when signals disagree)
- Confidence rating: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

**Bias Interpretation:**

| Put/Call Ratio | Bias |
|----------------|------|
| >2.0x | BEARISH |
| 1.2-2.0x | LEAN_BEARISH |
| 0.8-1.2x | NEUTRAL |
| 0.5-0.8x | LEAN_BULLISH |
| <0.5x | BULLISH |

**Flow Side Meaning:**
- **Bid-side dominant**: Trades at/below mid = selling pressure (closing longs OR opening shorts)
- **Ask-side dominant**: Trades at/above mid = buying pressure (opening longs)

Options flow is used to CONFIRM or CONTRADICT dark pool signals. Conflicting chain/flow signals reduce confidence.

---

## Analyst Ratings Command

Fetch analyst ratings, recent rating changes, and price targets.

**Data Sources (following standard priority):**
1. Interactive Brokers (`RESC` fundamental data) - requires Reuters subscription
2. Unusual Whales (`/api/screener/analysts`) - aggregates per-firm consensus, targets, history
3. Yahoo Finance - **ABSOLUTE LAST RESORT** — only if IB AND UW both fail (rate limited, unreliable)

```bash
# Scan specific tickers (auto-detects IB, falls back to Yahoo)
python3.13 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py AAPL MSFT NVDA

# Scan all watchlist tickers
python3.13 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py --watchlist

# Scan all portfolio positions
python3.13 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py --portfolio

# Scan both watchlist and portfolio
python3.13 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py --all

# Only show tickers with recent changes (upgrades/downgrades)
python3.13 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py --portfolio --changes-only

# Update watchlist.json with analyst rating data
python3.13 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py --watchlist --update-watchlist

# Force specific data source
python3.13 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py AAPL --source yahoo  # LAST RESORT ONLY
python3.13 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py AAPL --source ib

# Custom IB port
python3.13 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py --portfolio --port 7497

# Bypass cache
python3.13 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py AAPL --no-cache

# Output raw JSON
python3.13 scripts/fetch_analyst_ratings.py AAPL --json
```

**Output Includes:**
- Recommendation (Strong Buy → Sell)
- Buy/Hold/Sell percentage breakdown
- Analyst count (confidence indicator)
- Mean price target and upside/downside %
- Recent rating distribution changes
- Upgrade/downgrade history (firm, action, date)

**Signal Interpretation:**

| Buy % | Direction | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| ≥70% | BULLISH | Strong consensus |
| 50-69% | LEAN_BULLISH | Positive bias |
| 30-49% | LEAN_BEARISH | Negative bias |
| <30% | BEARISH | Strong negative consensus |

| Analyst Count | Confidence |
|---------------|------------|
| ≥20 | HIGH |
| 10-19 | MEDIUM |
| <10 | LOW |

**Changes Signal:**
- `UPGRADING` — Net increase in Buy/Strong Buy ratings
- `DOWNGRADING` — Net increase in Sell/Strong Sell ratings

Analyst ratings are CONTEXT, not a gate. Use for:
- Confirming or questioning flow signals
- Identifying contrarian opportunities (strong flow vs. weak ratings)
- Monitoring positions for sentiment shifts

---

## Seasonal Command

Usage: `seasonal [TICKER]` or `seasonal [TICKER1] [TICKER2] ...`

**Process:**
1. Download chart: `curl -s -o /tmp/{TICKER}_sheet.png "https://charts.equityclock.com/seasonal_charts/{TICKER}_sheet.png"`
2. Read image and extract monthly data table
3. Identify current month and next 2-3 months
4. Assign rating (FAVORABLE / NEUTRAL / UNFAVORABLE)
5. Output summary table with actionable context

**Output includes:**
- Current month: win rate, avg return, max, min
- Next 2-3 months outlook (for hold-through scenarios)
- Best/worst months of year
- Rating with reasoning

---

## Trade Blotter Command

Fetch and reconcile trades from Interactive Brokers. Calculates P&L deterministically including all commissions/fees.

```bash
# Today's trades with spread grouping
python3.13 scripts/blotter.py

# P&L summary only
python3.13 scripts/blotter.py --summary

# JSON output for programmatic use
python3.13 scripts/blotter.py --json

# Show execution details
python3.13 scripts/blotter.py --verbose

# Custom IB port
python3.13 scripts/blotter.py --port 7497
```

**Output Includes:**
- All today's fills grouped by contract
- Spread identification (put spreads, call spreads, risk reversals)
- Combined P&L for multi-leg spreads
- Commission totals
- Open vs closed position status

**Spread Types Detected:**
| Pattern | Name |
|---------|------|
| Long higher strike put + Short lower strike put | Put Spread |
| Short higher strike put + Long lower strike put | Put Spread (Bull) |
| Long call + Short call (same expiry) | Call Spread |
| Short put + Long call (same expiry) | Risk Reversal |
| Long put + Short call (same expiry) | Collar |

**P&L Calculation:**
- Cash flow = notional value ± commission (buy = negative, sell = positive)
- Realized P&L = sum of all cash flows for closed positions
- Commissions are always subtracted from cash flow
- All calculations use Decimal for precision

**Integration Tests:**
```bash
python3.13 scripts/trade_blotter/test_integration.py
```

## Monitor Daemon Service

A single extensible daemon that handles all background monitoring tasks.

### Handlers

| Handler | Interval | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `fill_monitor` | 60s | Detect order fills, send notifications (market hours only) |
| `exit_orders` | 300s | Place pending exit orders when IB accepts them (market hours only) |
| `preset_rebalance` | Weekly | Check SP500/NDX100/R2K for constituent changes, update presets (allowed off-hours) |
| `flex_token_check` | Daily | Warn before the IB Flex Web Service token expires (allowed off-hours) |

### Commands

```bash
# Status
python3.13 -m monitor_daemon.run --status

# Run once (for testing)
python3.13 -m monitor_daemon.run --once

# Run as daemon
python3.13 -m monitor_daemon.run --daemon

# List available handlers
python3.13 -m monitor_daemon.run --list-handlers
```

### Service Management

```bash
# Install launchd service (launchd runs `--once` every 60s; each handler
# applies its own market-hours policy)
./scripts/setup_monitor_daemon.sh install

# Check status
./scripts/setup_monitor_daemon.sh status

# View logs
./scripts/setup_monitor_daemon.sh logs

# Test run
./scripts/setup_monitor_daemon.sh test

# Uninstall
./scripts/setup_monitor_daemon.sh uninstall
```

### Adding New Handlers

1. Create `scripts/monitor_daemon/handlers/my_handler.py`
2. Inherit from `BaseHandler`
3. Implement `execute()` method
4. Register in `run.py` `create_daemon()`

Example:
```python
from monitor_daemon.handlers.base import BaseHandler

class MyHandler(BaseHandler):
    name = "my_handler"
    interval_seconds = 120  # Run every 2 minutes
    
    def execute(self) -> dict:
        # Your monitoring logic here
        return {"status": "ok", "data": {...}}
```

### State Persistence

Handler state (last run times, known orders) is saved to:
```
data/daemon_state.json
```

### Logs

```
logs/monitor-daemon.log      # Main daemon log
logs/monitor-daemon.out.log  # launchd stdout
logs/monitor-daemon.err.log  # launchd stderr
```

## Flex Query Setup (Historical Trades)

The real-time IB API only provides **today's fills**. To calculate P&L for positions opened/closed on previous days, you need to set up IB Flex Query for historical data.

### One-Time Setup

**Step 1: Login to IB Account Management**
```
https://www.interactivebrokers.com/sso/Login
```

**Step 2: Create a Flex Query**
1. Navigate to: **Reports → Flex Queries**
2. Click **"+ Create"** under "Activity Flex Query"
3. Configure:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Query Name | `Trade History` |
| **Sections** | ☑️ Trades, ☑️ Commission Details |
| Format | `XML` |
| Period | `Last 365 Calendar Days` |
| Breakout by Day | `Yes` |

4. Click **Continue**
5. In Trades section, select **ALL fields** (or at minimum: Symbol, DateTime, Buy/Sell, Quantity, TradePrice, Commission, Strike, Expiry, Put/Call, TradeID)
6. Click **Save**
7. Note the **Query ID** displayed (e.g., `1422766`)

**Step 3: Get Flex Web Service Token**
1. Navigate to: **Reports → Settings → Flex Web Service**
2. Click **Generate Token**
3. Note the token string

**Step 4: Configure Environment**
Add to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:
```bash
export IB_FLEX_TOKEN="your_token_here"
export IB_FLEX_QUERY_ID="your_query_id_here"
```

Then reload:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Usage

```bash
# Fetch all historical trades
python3.13 scripts/trade_blotter/flex_query.py

# Filter by symbol
python3.13 scripts/trade_blotter/flex_query.py --symbol EWY

# JSON output
python3.13 scripts/trade_blotter/flex_query.py --json

# Pass credentials directly (if not using env vars)
python3.13 scripts/trade_blotter/flex_query.py --token YOUR_TOKEN --query-id YOUR_QUERY_ID

# Show setup guide
python3.13 scripts/trade_blotter/flex_query.py --setup
```

### What Flex Query Provides

| Data | Real-time API | Flex Query |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Today's fills | ✅ | ✅ |
| Historical fills (1-365 days) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Commission details | ✅ | ✅ |
| Open/Close indicator | ❌ | ✅ |
| Trade ID for reconciliation | ✅ | ✅ |

## ⚠️ Portfolio Source of Truth (CRITICAL)

**Interactive Brokers is the ONLY source of truth for current portfolio state.**

- **NEVER claim a position exists or doesn't exist based on `docs/status.md` or `data/portfolio.json`.** These are caches that go stale.
- **ALWAYS verify against IB** (`python3.13 scripts/ib_sync.py`) before making any statement about current holdings.
- `docs/status.md` is a **decision log and audit trail** — NOT a live portfolio dashboard.
- `data/portfolio.json` is a **cache** updated by `ib_sync.py --sync`. It may be hours or days old.
- When IB is unavailable, say so explicitly: *"Cannot verify — IB unavailable."* Do NOT fall back to status.md.

## Output Format

- Always show: signal → structure → Kelly math → decision
- State probability estimates explicitly, flag uncertainty
- When a trade doesn't meet criteria, say so immediately with the failing gate
- Never rationalize a bad trade
- Log EXECUTED trades to trade_log.json
- Log NO_TRADE decisions to docs/status.md (Recent Evaluations section)

## Trade Specification Reports ⭐ REQUIRED

**When recommending ANY trade, ALWAYS generate a Trade Specification HTML report.**

```bash
# Template location
.pi/skills/html-report/trade-specification-template.html

# Output location
reports/{ticker}-evaluation-{DATE}.html

# Example
reports/goog-evaluation-2026-03-04.html
```

**This is MANDATORY for:**
- Any `evaluate [TICKER]` that reaches the Structure milestone
- Any trade recommendation before execution
- Any position proposal requiring user confirmation

**Required sections (10 total):**
1. Header with ticker, company, price, gate status (ALL GATES PASSED / FAILED)
2. Summary Metrics (6): signal score, buy ratio, flow strength, convexity, position size, max gain
3. Milestone Summary with pass/fail status for all 7 milestones
4. Dark Pool Flow Section: daily breakdown + aggregate analysis
5. Options Flow Section: chain bias, institutional flow, combined signal
6. Context Section: seasonality + analyst ratings + news & catalysts
7. Structure & Kelly: position structure and Kelly sizing
8. Trade Specification: exact order details ready for execution
9. Thesis & Risk Factors callouts
10. Four Gates Summary table

**Reference implementation:** `reports/goog-evaluation-2026-03-04.html`

**Workflow:**
1. Complete evaluation milestones 1-6
2. Generate HTML report with all data
3. Present to user for confirmation
4. On "execute" → place order via IB
5. On fill → update trade_log.json, portfolio.json, status.md

## P&L Reports

**When generating any P&L report, ALWAYS use the P&L template:**

```bash
# Template location
.pi/skills/html-report/pnl-template.html

# Output location
reports/pnl-{TICKER}-{DATE}.html
```

**Required sections for every P&L report:**
1. Header with CLOSED/OPEN status pill
2. 4 metrics: Realized P&L, Commissions, Hold Period, Return on Risk
3. Trade Summary callout (strategy, thesis, outcome)
4. Execution table(s) with cash flows per leg
5. Combined P&L panel (for spreads)
6. Trade timeline
7. Footer with data source

**Return on Risk formula:**
```
Return on Risk = Realized P&L / Capital at Risk

Capital at Risk:
  - Debit spread: Net debit paid
  - Credit spread: Max loss (width - credit)
  - Long option: Premium paid
  - Stock: Cost basis
```

See `.pi/skills/html-report/SKILL.md` for full template documentation.

## ⚠️ GARCH Convergence → ALWAYS Call `garch_convergence.py` (MANDATORY)

**Any request for a GARCH convergence scan — regardless of how the user phrases it — MUST route to:**
```bash
python3.13 scripts/garch_convergence.py --preset [PRESET]
```

This is non-negotiable. The script fetches ALL ticker data in parallel (8 workers), computes divergence metrics, and generates the HTML report automatically.

**NEVER manually fetch IV/HV data ticker-by-ticker or build reports inline.** The script does everything in ~3 seconds for 23 tickers.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Built-in presets
python3.13 scripts/garch_convergence.py --preset semis
python3.13 scripts/garch_convergence.py --preset mega-tech
python3.13 scripts/garch_convergence.py --preset energy
python3.13 scripts/garch_convergence.py --preset china-etf
python3.13 scripts/garch_convergence.py --preset all          # All 4 built-in presets

# File presets (data/presets/)
python3.13 scripts/garch_convergence.py --preset sp500-semiconductors
python3.13 scripts/garch_convergence.py --preset ndx100-biotech

# Ad-hoc tickers (paired consecutively)
python3.13 scripts/garch_convergence.py NVDA AMD GOOGL META

# Options
python3.13 scripts/garch_convergence.py --preset all --json   # JSON output
python3.13 scripts/garch_convergence.py --preset all --no-open # Don't open browser
```

**Output:** `reports/garch-convergence-{preset}-{date}.html` (auto-opens in browser)

**Strategy spec:** `docs/strategy-garch-convergence.md`

## FastAPI Server Architecture

Next.js API routes call a local FastAPI server (`scripts/api/server.py` on `localhost:8321`) via `radonFetch()` (`web/lib/radonApi.ts`) instead of spawning Python processes.

**Three-Service Dev Stack** (`npm run dev`):

| Service | Port | Process |
|---------|------|---------|
| Next.js | 3000 | `next dev` |
| IB WS relay | 8765 | `ib_realtime_server.js` (real-time price streaming) |
| FastAPI | 8321 | `uvicorn scripts.api.server:app` (Python script execution) |

**Graceful degradation:** FastAPI down → Next.js serves cached files with `is_stale: true`. No spawn fallback.

**IB Gateway auto-recovery:** FastAPI detects Gateway down at startup and auto-restarts via `~/ibc/bin/restart-secure-ibc-service.sh`. IB-dependent endpoints detect `ECONNREFUSED`, auto-restart Gateway, reconnect pool, retry once. Manual: `POST http://localhost:8321/ib/restart`.

**Health check:** `curl http://localhost:8321/health` — returns `ib_gateway`, `ib_pool`, `uw`, and `test_mode` status.

**Test-mode FastAPI harness:** `web/tests/order-e2e.test.ts` uses `web/tests/fastapiHarness.ts` to launch an isolated FastAPI instance on a random local port with `RADON_API_TEST_MODE=1`. In test mode, `scripts/api/server.py` skips IB Gateway / pool startup and stubs the order endpoints. The harness must not reuse the live broker-backed `localhost:8321` server unless that server explicitly reports `test_mode: true` on `/health`.

| FastAPI File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/api/server.py` | FastAPI app — 17 endpoints, CORS, IB pool, health check |
| `scripts/api/ib_pool.py` | Role-based IB connection pool (sync=0, orders=1, data=2) |
| `scripts/api/ib_gateway.py` | IB Gateway health check + auto-restart via IBC launchd |
| `scripts/api/subprocess.py` | Async subprocess helper (`run_script`, `run_module`) |
| `web/tests/fastapiHarness.ts` | Vitest-only FastAPI launcher for isolated order-route integration tests |

| `scripts/context_constructor.py` | **⭐ Context pipeline: load persistent memory at startup, save facts/episodes** |

## ⚠️ Order Execution (CRITICAL)

**When placing ANY order, ALWAYS use `ib_execute.py`.**

This script automatically:
1. Places the order
2. Monitors for fills (real-time)
3. Logs filled trades to `trade_log.json`

**NEVER place orders manually without monitoring and logging.**

### Stock Orders
```bash
# Sell stock
python3.13 scripts/ib_execute.py --type stock --symbol NFLX --qty 4500 --side SELL --limit 98.70 --yes

# Buy stock
python3.13 scripts/ib_execute.py --type stock --symbol AAPL --qty 100 --side BUY --limit BID --yes
```

### Option Orders
```bash
# Buy call at mid
python3.13 scripts/ib_execute.py --type option --symbol GOOG --expiry 20260417 --strike 315 --right C --qty 10 --side BUY --limit MID --yes

# Sell put
python3.13 scripts/ib_execute.py --type option --symbol GOOG --expiry 20260417 --strike 290 --right P --qty 5 --side SELL --limit 3.50 --yes
```

### Limit Price Options
| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `MID` | Use current mid price |
| `BID` | Use current bid price |
| `ASK` | Use current ask price |
| `9.50` | Use exact price |

### Flags
| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--yes` / `-y` | Skip confirmation prompt |
| `--dry-run` | Preview without placing |
| `--timeout N` | Monitor timeout (default: 60s) |
| `--no-log` | Don't log to trade_log.json |
| `--thesis "..."` | Add thesis to log entry |
| `--notes "..."` | Add notes to log entry |

## ⚠️ Post-Trade Logging (MANDATORY — NO EXCEPTIONS)

**After ANY order is filled — whether via `ib_execute.py`, combo order script, or manual IB placement — ALL THREE logging steps below MUST be completed IMMEDIATELY. Do NOT move on to other tasks, do NOT generate reports, do NOT respond to the user with "done" until all three are complete.**

**This is the #1 process failure mode. It has been violated before. It will not be violated again.**

### Step 1: trade_log.json (automatic or manual)
- `ib_execute.py` logs automatically for single-leg orders
- For combo/spread orders placed via inline Python, you MUST append to `data/trade_log.json` in the same script or immediately after
- Required fields: `id`, `date`, `time`, `ticker`, `company_name`, `contract`, `structure`, `action`, `decision`, `order_id`, `quantity`, `fill_price`, `total_cost`, `max_risk`, `max_gain`, `pct_of_bankroll`, `edge_analysis`, `kelly_calculation`, `gates_passed`, `target_exit`, `stop_loss`, `notes`
- Validate: `python3.13 -m json.tool data/trade_log.json`

### Step 2: docs/status.md (ALWAYS — never skip)
Update ALL of the following sections:
1. **Last Updated** timestamp
2. **Today's Trades** table — add the new trade with fill price and status
3. **Trade Log Summary** table — add the new row with ID, date, ticker, structure, status
4. **Logged Position Thesis Check** — add full thesis block for the new position:
   - Entry price and date
   - Edge source and flow data at entry
   - Kelly parameters
   - R:R ratio
   - Thesis status (INTACT/WEAKENING/etc.)
5. **Rule Violations** — add if the trade creates any violations (undefined risk, oversize)
6. **Current Portfolio State** — update position count if significantly changed

### Step 3: Validate
```bash
python3.13 -m json.tool data/trade_log.json
```

### Trigger
This workflow triggers on ANY of these events:
- `ib_execute.py` reports a fill
- Inline Python combo order fill
- Startup reconciliation detects new trades (`needs_attention: true`)
- Manual confirmation that an order filled in TWS

**If you find yourself saying "✅ FILLED" to the user without having updated status.md, you have failed this process.**

---

## Interactive Brokers Integration

### Auto-Recovery (FastAPI)

The FastAPI server (`scripts/api/ib_gateway.py`) handles IB Gateway recovery automatically:

1. **Startup:** Checks port 4001 → if down, runs `~/ibc/bin/restart-secure-ibc-service.sh`, polls up to 45s
2. **Runtime:** IB-dependent endpoints detect `ECONNREFUSED` → auto-restart Gateway → reconnect pool → retry once
3. **Manual:** `curl -X POST http://localhost:8321/ib/restart` or `POST /ib/restart`
4. **Health:** `curl http://localhost:8321/health` → shows `ib_gateway.port_listening` + `ib_pool` status

**2FA requirement:** Cold starts (Gateway was fully stopped) require approving push notification on IBKR Mobile. Warm restarts (IBC nightly 11:58 PM) reuse auth session — no 2FA needed.

### Connection Troubleshooting

**Full runbook:** `docs/ib-connection-troubleshooting.md`

**Quick triage (run these in order):**

```bash
# 1. FastAPI health check (preferred — shows Gateway + pool status)
curl -s http://localhost:8321/health | python3.13 -m json.tool

# 2. Gateway process running?
~/ibc/bin/status-secure-ibc-service.sh | grep -E "state|pid"

# 3. Port 4001 listening?
lsof -iTCP:4001 -sTCP:LISTEN

# 4. Manual restart if auto-recovery failed
curl -X POST http://localhost:8321/ib/restart
```

**Common failure scenarios:**

| Scenario | Process? | Port listening? | Connects? | Fix |
|----------|----------|----------------|-----------|-----|
| Gateway down | No | No | No | `~/ibc/bin/start-secure-ibc-service.sh` + approve 2FA |
| **Zombie state** | Yes | Yes | **No** | `~/ibc/bin/restart-secure-ibc-service.sh` + approve 2FA |
| Client ID collision | Yes | Yes | Yes | Kill stale script holding the client ID |
| 2FA pending | Yes | Yes | No | Approve push notification on IBKR Mobile |

**Zombie state is the most common failure.** The Java process is alive and the socket is bound, but the API layer stopped accepting connections (session expired, 2FA timeout, IBC nightly restart failed).

**Timeout budget when Gateway is unreachable:**

| Layer | Time | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `IBClient.connect()` | 3s | Default timeout (lowered from 10s) |
| Cached fallback read | <50ms | Serves `data/portfolio.json` or `data/orders.json` |
| **Total API response** | **~3.5s** | Returns 200 with `X-Sync-Warning` header |

**Automated recovery layers:** FastAPI Gateway auto-restart on ECONNREFUSED (retry once) > IBClient reconnect (5 attempts, exponential backoff) > WS server reconnect (5s interval, client ID rotation) > cached fallback (serve stale data as 200 with `is_stale: true`) > IBC auto-restart (nightly 11:58 PM) > 2FA retry (`TWOFA_TIMEOUT_ACTION=restart`).

### Client ID Strategy

**Default to `clientId=0` (master client)** for full order control.

| clientId | Privileges | Scripts |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **0** (master) | Can cancel/modify ANY order | `ib_sync`, `ib_reconcile`, `ib_order_manage` — also FastAPI pool `sync` role |
| **11** | Orders visibility | `ib_orders` — also FastAPI pool `orders` role |
| **26** | Order placement | `ib_place_order` (on-demand connect/disconnect) |
| **31** | Data queries | `cri_scan` — also FastAPI pool `data` role |
| **40** | Portfolio sync subprocess | FastAPI `/portfolio/sync` (avoids pool collision) |
| **41** | Orders sync subprocess | FastAPI `/orders/refresh` (avoids pool collision) |
| **100** | Streaming | `ib_realtime_server` (WS relay) |

**Why master client:**
- Can cancel orders placed via TWS (which have `orderId=0`)
- Full visibility into all account orders
- Required for `ib_order_manage.py` cancel/modify operations

**When to use unique clientId:**
- Long-running services (streaming, monitoring) that shouldn't block other connections
- Order placement (tags orders with clientId for tracking)
- Multiple concurrent connections required

**Critical:** Only ONE connection can use `clientId=0` at a time.

### Portfolio Sync (Periodic)

```bash
# Display live portfolio (requires TWS/Gateway running)
python3.13 scripts/ib_sync.py

# Sync to portfolio.json
python3.13 scripts/ib_sync.py --sync

# Connect to different ports
python3.13 scripts/ib_sync.py --port 7496   # TWS Live
python3.13 scripts/ib_sync.py --port 7497   # TWS Paper (default)
python3.13 scripts/ib_sync.py --port 4001   # IB Gateway Live
python3.13 scripts/ib_sync.py --port 4002   # IB Gateway Paper
```

### Covered Call Detection (Automatic)

**Both `ib_sync.py` and `portfolio_report.py` automatically detect covered calls.**

When a ticker has both long stock AND short calls:
- Stock shares ≥ short call contracts × 100 → **Covered Call** (defined risk ✅)
- Stock shares < short call contracts × 100 → **Partially Covered Call** (undefined risk ⛔)

**How it works:** Positions are initially grouped by `(symbol, expiry)`. Since stock has no expiry and options do, they end up in separate groups. A second pass (`_merge_covered_call_groups`) detects matching pairs and merges them before structure detection runs.

**Example:** 4,000 shares URTY + 40 short URTY calls = Covered Call (4,000 shares cover 40×100 = 4,000 shares). This is **defined risk**, not a rule violation.

**What is NOT a covered call:**
- Short put + long stock (different risk profile)
- Short call without matching stock (naked call = undefined)
- Stock in ticker A + short call in ticker B (different underlyings)

**Tests:** `scripts/tests/test_covered_call_detection.py` (7 tests)

### All-Long Combo Detection (Automatic)

**`ib_sync.py` automatically classifies all-long option combos as defined risk.**

When a multi-leg position has ALL long option legs (no short legs, no stock):
- All calls → **Long Call Combo** (defined risk ✅)
- All puts → **Long Put Combo** (defined risk ✅)
- Mixed calls + puts → **Long Combo** (defined risk ✅)

**Example:** AAOI 25x Long $105 Call + 25x Long $130 Call = `Long Call Combo (2 legs)`, `risk_profile: "defined"`. Max loss = total premium paid.

**Web UI fallback:** If any position has `risk_profile: "complex"` (unrecognized structure), it falls into the Undefined Risk table as defense-in-depth rather than being silently dropped.

**Tests:** `scripts/tests/test_all_long_combo.py` (8 tests), `web/tests/complex-risk-profile.test.ts` (5 tests)

### Startup Protocol (Full Visibility)

When Pi starts, the startup extension (`.pi/extensions/startup-protocol.ts`) runs all checks with **numbered progress indicators**:

**Example output (market open, with persistent memory):**
```
🚀 Startup: Running 6 checks...
[1/6] ✓ Market OPEN (2h 30m to close)
[2/6] ✓ Loaded: Spec, Plans, Runbook, Status, Context Engineering, Memory (7F/1E/0H)
[3/6] ✓ IB trades in sync
[4/6] ✓ Monitor daemon running
[5/6] ✓ Free Trade Progress:
       EWY: 100% 🎉 FREE
       PLTR: 89% ⚡ Near
[6/6] ✓ X scan: 54 tweets, 40 updated
✅ Startup complete (6/6 passed)
```

**Memory label format:** `Memory (NF/NE/NH)` = N Facts / N Episodes / N Human annotations

**Example output (market closed):**
```
🚀 Startup: Running 6 checks...
[1/6] ⚠️ Market CLOSED (after hours) — using closing prices
[2/6] ✓ Loaded: Spec, Plans, Runbook, Status, Context Engineering, Memory (7F/1E/0H)
...
```

**Market Hours Check:**
- First process in every startup
- Shows warning icon (⚠️) when market is closed
- Indicates that free trade progress uses closing prices (not real-time)
- Uses Eastern Time (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)

**X Account Scan:**
- Runs automatically on **every startup**
- Output: `@account: N tickers` — Number of tickers found in recent tweets

**Processes tracked (in order):**

| # | Process | Type | Description |
|---|---------|------|-------------|
| 1 | `market` | sync | Market hours check (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET) |
| 2 | `docs` | sync | Load project docs + always-on skills |
| 3 | `ib` | async | IB trade reconciliation (runs first, updates portfolio) |
| 4 | `free_trade` | async | Free trade scan (waits for IB to complete) |
| 5 | `daemon` | sync | Monitor daemon status check |
| 6+ | `x_{account}` | async | X account scans (parallel with above) |

**Note:** Free trade analysis depends on IB sync because closed positions affect which multi-leg positions exist.

**Status indicators:**
- `✓` — Success
- `⚠️` — Warning (skipped or issue)
- `❌` — Error (failed)

**Final summary:**
- `✅ Startup complete (N/N passed)` — All processes succeeded
- `⚠️ Startup complete (X/N passed, Y warnings)` — Some warnings
- `❌ Startup complete (X/N passed, Y failed)` — Some failures

**Implementation:** Uses `StartupTracker` class with 14 TDD tests.

**Test the startup protocol:**
```bash
npx tsx .pi/tests/startup-protocol.test.ts
```

### ⚠️ Auto-Reconciliation Rule (MANDATORY)

**When IB sync detects new trades (`needs_attention: true`), IMMEDIATELY:**

1. **Read** `data/reconciliation.json` to get the new trades
2. **Log** each new trade to `data/trade_log.json` with:
   - Unique ID (auto-increment from last)
   - Full trade details from reconciliation
   - `validation_method: "ib_reconciliation"`
   - Realized P&L and commissions
3. **Update** `docs/status.md`:
   - Trade Log Summary table
   - Today's Trades section
   - Portfolio State metrics
   - Rule Violations if applicable
4. **Clear** reconciliation flag:
   - Set `needs_attention: false`
   - Move trades to `processed_trades` array
5. **Validate** JSON integrity:
   ```bash
   python3.13 -m json.tool data/trade_log.json
   ```

**This is automatic — do NOT wait for user to request it.**

**Reconciliation data format:**
```json
{
  "new_trades": [
    {
      "symbol": "PLTR",
      "date": "2026-03-04",
      "action": "SELL_OPTION",  // SELL_OPTION, BUY_OPTION, CLOSED, etc.
      "net_quantity": -100.0,
      "avg_price": 9.18,
      "commission": 70.25,
      "realized_pnl": 48479.75,
      "sec_type": "OPT"  // OPT, STK, BAG
    }
  ],
  "needs_attention": true
}
```

**Action interpretation:**
| Action | Meaning | Log As |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `SELL_OPTION` | Sold options (closing long OR opening short) | Check context |
| `BUY_OPTION` | Bought options (opening long OR closing short) | Check context |
| `CLOSED` | Position fully closed (net zero) | CLOSED with P&L |
| `BUY` / `SELL` | Stock trade | Stock entry/exit |

### Startup Reconciliation (Automatic)

When Pi starts, the startup extension automatically runs `ib_reconcile.py` **asynchronously** (non-blocking) to detect:

1. **New trades** — Executions in IB not logged in `trade_log.json`
2. **New positions** — Positions in IB not in `portfolio.json`
3. **Closed positions** — Positions in `portfolio.json` no longer in IB

**How it works:**
- Runs in background via `spawn()` — does not block Pi startup
- Connects to IB Gateway/TWS (port 4001 by default)
- Compares IB executions and positions to local files
- Writes results to `data/reconciliation.json`
- Shows notification if reconciliation needed

**Notifications (via StartupTracker):**
- `[N/M] ✓ IB trades in sync` — No discrepancies found
- `[N/M] ⚠️ IB: 3 new trades, 1 closed position` — Action needed
- `[N/M] ⚠️ IB not connected (skipped)` — IB unavailable

**Manual run:**
```bash
python3.13 scripts/ib_reconcile.py
```

**Reconciliation report:**
```bash
cat data/reconciliation.json | python3.13 -m json.tool
```

**Actions detected:**
| Action | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| BUY | Opened long stock position |
| SELL | Closed long position (realized P&L) |
| SHORT | Opened short stock position |
| COVER | Closed short position |
| BUY_OPTION | Bought to open option |
| SELL_OPTION | Sold to close option |
| CLOSED | Position fully closed (net zero) |

### Exit Order Service (Automatic)

Monitors positions with pending manual exit orders and places them when IB will accept them. Runs automatically at Pi startup and can run as a periodic service.

**Background:** IB rejects limit orders that are too far from current market price (typically >40% away). This service monitors pending target exit orders and places them when the spread price gets close enough.

**Startup behavior:**
- Runs automatically when Pi starts (via `startup-protocol.ts`)
- Checks all positions with `PENDING_MANUAL` exit orders
- Attempts to place orders if spread is within 40% of target
- Notifies if any orders are placed

**Manual commands:**
```bash
# Check status of pending orders
python3.13 scripts/exit_order_service.py --status

# Run single check (place orders if possible)
python3.13 scripts/exit_order_service.py

# Dry run (preview without placing)
python3.13 scripts/exit_order_service.py --dry-run

# Run as daemon (every 5 mins during market hours)
python3.13 scripts/exit_order_service.py --daemon
```

**Periodic execution (launchd):**
```bash
# Install as macOS launchd service (runs every 5 minutes)
./scripts/setup_exit_order_service.sh install

# Check service status
./scripts/setup_exit_order_service.sh status

# View logs
./scripts/setup_exit_order_service.sh logs

# Uninstall service
./scripts/setup_exit_order_service.sh uninstall
```

**Log location:** `logs/exit-order-service.out.log`

**How it determines when to place:**
- Current spread price × 1.40 = Maximum placeable target
- Example: If spread is at $9.00, can place orders up to $12.60
- Orders farther away wait until spread appreciates

**Trade log integration:**
- Reads `exit_orders.target.status == "PENDING_MANUAL"` from trade_log.json
- Updates status to "ACTIVE" with `order_id` when placed

### Real-Time Price Streaming

Separate from portfolio sync - streams live prices via WebSocket.

```bash
# Start the real-time price server
# Start the Node.js realtime server from the web package
node ../web/scripts/ib_realtime_server.js

# Custom ports
node ../web/scripts/ib_realtime_server.js --port 8765 --ib-port 4001

# Test connectivity
python3.13 scripts/test_ib_realtime.py
python3.13 scripts/test_ib_realtime.py --ib-only   # Test IB only
python3.13 scripts/test_ib_realtime.py --ws-only   # Test WebSocket only
```

**WebSocket Protocol:**
```json
// Subscribe to symbols
{"action": "subscribe", "symbols": ["AAPL", "MSFT"]}

// Unsubscribe
{"action": "unsubscribe", "symbols": ["AAPL"]}

// One-time snapshot
{"action": "snapshot", "symbols": ["NVDA"]}

// Server sends price updates
{"type": "price", "symbol": "AAPL", "data": {"last": 175.50, "bid": 175.48, ...}}
```

**Next.js Integration:**
- API Route: `POST /api/prices` for one-time snapshot (body `{ "symbols": [...] }`)
- `GET /api/prices` is deprecated (`405`) and does not stream real-time data.
- Live pricing is end-to-end on Node via websocket; Next.js does not proxy live frames.
- React Hook: `usePrices({ symbols: ["AAPL", "MSFT"] })`

**Setup:**
1. Install project dependencies (`npm install` in `/web`) for the Node websocket server.
2. For IB + websocket connectivity tests, keep Python deps installed as needed (example: `pip install ib_insync websockets`).
3. In TWS: Configure → API → Settings → Enable "ActiveX and Socket Clients"
4. Ensure "Read-Only API" is unchecked if you want order capability later

## Context Engineering (Persistent Memory)

The project uses a file-system-based context repository (`context/`) for persistent memory across sessions. The **Context Constructor** (`scripts/context_constructor.py`) runs automatically at every startup via the startup protocol extension.

### How It Works

**At startup (automatic):**
1. The startup extension calls `context_constructor.py --json` 
2. Constructor reads all facts, episodic summaries, and human annotations
3. Assembles a token-budgeted payload (default 8000 tokens)
4. Injects into the system prompt as `PERSISTENT MEMORY` section
5. Reports count in startup notification: `Loaded: Spec, Plans, ..., Memory (7F/1E/0H)`

**During/after sessions (manual):**
```bash
# Save a fact (learning, rule, observation)
python3.13 scripts/context_constructor.py --save-fact "key.name" "Fact content" --confidence 0.95 --source "evaluation-TICKER-DATE"

# Save a session summary (episodic memory)
python3.13 scripts/context_constructor.py --save-episode "What happened this session" --session-id "session-2026-03-06"

# View current context
python3.13 scripts/context_constructor.py

# JSON output
python3.13 scripts/context_constructor.py --json
```

### When to Save Facts

Save a fact after any of these events:
- **Evaluation lesson** — A trade failed/passed for a non-obvious reason (e.g., low-vol Kelly failure)
- **Infrastructure discovery** — API quirk, data source behavior (e.g., UW requires `requests` not `urllib`)
- **Portfolio state change** — Significant change in position count, deployed %, violations
- **Pattern recognition** — Recurring market behavior (e.g., "institutions accumulate 3-4 days then stop")

### Memory Types

| Directory | Type | Lifecycle | Example |
|-----------|------|-----------|---------|
| `context/memory/fact/` | Atomic facts | Permanent, deduplicated | `trading.lesson.low-vol-kelly` |
| `context/memory/episodic/` | Session summaries | 1 year retention | `session-2026-03-06-morning` |
| `context/memory/experiential/` | Action→outcome trajectories | Permanent | Observation-action-outcome tuples |
| `context/human/` | Human overrides | Permanent, highest priority | Annotations that override model output |
| `context/history/` | Transaction log | Permanent, append-only | All read/write operations |

### Fact Schema

```json
{
  "id": "fact-trading-lesson-low-vol-kelly",
  "key": "trading.lesson.low-vol-kelly",
  "value": "Description of the fact...",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "source": "evaluation-IBM-2026-03-05",
  "createdAt": "2026-03-06T17:45:18Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-03-06T17:45:18Z",
  "revisionId": 1,
  "expiresAt": null
}
```

### Governance

- **Token budget**: 8000 tokens for memory payload (within 200K context window)
- **Priority**: Human annotations > Facts > Episodic summaries > Experiential
- **Deduplication**: Same key overwrites with incremented revisionId
- **Transaction log**: Every read/write logged to `context/history/_transactions.jsonl`

## Discovery Scoring (0-100 Scale)

## Discovery Scoring (0-100 Scale)

When running `discover`, candidates are scored on edge quality:

| Component | Weight | Measure |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| DP Strength | 30% | Dark pool flow imbalance (0-100) |
| DP Sustained | 20% | Consecutive days same direction |
| Confluence | 20% | Options + DP alignment |
| Vol/OI Ratio | 15% | Unusual volume indicator |
| Sweeps | 15% | Urgency signal |

Score interpretation:
- **60-100**: Strong — worth full evaluation
- **40-59**: Moderate — monitor closely
- **20-39**: Weak — early stage or conflicting
- **0-19**: No actionable signal

### OI Change Discovery (Market-Wide)

**ALWAYS check market-wide OI changes as part of discovery:**

```bash
# Find massive institutional positioning across all tickers
python3.13 scripts/fetch_oi_changes.py --market --min-premium 10000000
```

This surfaces positions that may NOT appear in flow alerts because they don't trigger "unusual" filters. The $95M MSFT LEAP calls were discovered this way.

**OI changes > $10M premium are often:**
- Large institutions building positions
- Pre-earnings positioning
- Sector rotation signals
- LEAP accumulation (longer-term bets)
